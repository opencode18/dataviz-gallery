1
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:37,658
Peter.

2
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:42,264
Your momma wants to speak with you.

3
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,510
Come on, Pete.
Take these fool things off.

4
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:25,612
Why have you been fighting with
the other boys again, baby?

5
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,356
Peter?

6
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:33,050
They killed a little frog
that ain't done nothing.

7
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:36,261
Smushed it with a stick.

8
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,895
You're so like your daddy.

9
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,597
You even look like him.

10
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,927
And he was an angel.

11
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,642
- Composed out of pure light.
- Mer?

12
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:52,142
You got a present there
for Peter, don't you?

13
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,638
Of course.

14
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,910
There.

15
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,418
I've got you covered, Pete.

16
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,691
You open it up when I'm gone, okay?

17
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,793
Your grandpa

18
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,936
is gonna take such good care of you.

19
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:21,302
At least until your daddy
comes back to get you.

20
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,144
Take my hand.

21
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,378
Peter.

22
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,787
Pete, come on.

23
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,082
Take my hand.

24
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,063
Mom?

25
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,132
No! No! No! No!

26
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:47,567
Mom! No!

27
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,202
- Come with me.
- No!

28
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,531
No!

29
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,406
You've got to stay here. Please.

30
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,973
No...

31
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,808
Okay?

32
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,424
No.

33
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,709
Mom!

34
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,007
Drop it!

35
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,835
Hey.

36
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,112
- Drop it, now!
- Hey, cool, man. No problem.

37
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,646
No problem at all.

38
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,517
How do you know about this?

39
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,252
I don't even know what that is.

40
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,988
I'm just a junker, man.
I was just checking stuff out.

41
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,424
You don't look like a junker.
You're wearing Ravager garb.

42
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,792
This is just an outfit, man.

43
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,461
- Ninja Turtle, you better stop poking me.
- What is your name?

44
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,830
My name is Peter Quill, okay?
Dude, chill out.

45
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,331
- Move!
- Why?

46
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,734
Ronan may have questions for you.

47
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:58,295
Hey, you know what? There's another
name you might know me by.

48
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,008
Star-Lord.

49
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:06,137
- Who?
- Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw.

50
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:09,439
- Guys?
- Move!

51
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,543
Forget this.

52
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,862
Peter?

53
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,801
What happened?

54
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,229
Hey...

55
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,394
I...

56
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,742
- Bereet.
- Bereet!

57
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,776
Look, I'm gonna be totally honest
with you. I forgot you're here.

58
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:46,405
Scattered riots broke out
across the Kree Empire today

59
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:50,009
protesting the recent peace
treaty signed by the Kree Emperor

60
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:53,078
and Xandar's Nova Prime.

61
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,947
Peter, you have call.

62
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,443
- No, wait, don't!
- Quill?

63
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,788
Hey, Yondu.

64
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,957
I'm here on Morag.

65
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,258
Ain't no Orb, ain't no you.

66
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,527
Well, I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd save you the hassle.

67
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:09,895
Well, where are you at now, boy?

68
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,565
I feel really bad about this,
but I'm not gonna tell you that.

69
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,167
- I slaved putting this deal together.
- Slaved?

70
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,302
Making a few calls is "slaved"?
I mean, really?

71
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,436
And now you're gonna rip me off!

72
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:21,040
We do not do that to each other.
We're Ravagers. We got a code.

73
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,876
Yeah, and that code is
"steal from everybody."

74
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,845
- When I picked you up on Terra...
- "Picked me up."

75
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,881
- ...these boys of mine wanted to eat you.
- Yeah?

76
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:30,016
They ain't never tasted
any Terran before.

77
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,351
I stopped them.
You're alive because of me!

78
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,145
I will find you, I will...

79
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:37,790
Put a bounty on him! Forty K.

80
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,525
- But I want him back alive.
- Yeah, Cap.

81
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,060
- Alive?
- That's what I said.

82
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,499
I told you when you picked that kid up,
you should have delivered him

83
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,265
like we was hired to do!
He was cargo!

84
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:51,103
- You have always been soft on him.
- You're the only one I'm being soft on!

85
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,973
Now, don't you worry about Mr. Quill.

86
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,541
As soon as we get him back here,

87
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,378
I'm gonna kill him myself.

88
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,275
What we do need to worry about,

89
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:05,081
is who else out there wants that Orb!

90
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,734
They call me "terrorist,"

91
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,001
"radical," "zealot,"

92
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:35,005
because I obey the ancient
laws of my people, the Kree,

93
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,851
and punish those who do not.

94
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:42,088
Because I do not forgive your people

95
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:45,179
for taking the life of my father,

96
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,227
and his father,
and his father before him.

97
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:54,967
A thousand years of war between
us will not be forgotten!

98
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:58,365
You can't do this! Our government
signed a peace treaty.

99
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,801
My government knows no shame.

100
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:05,739
You Xandarians and your
culture are a disease.

101
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,713
You

102
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,116
will never rule Xandar.

103
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,705
No.

104
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,744
I will cure it!

105
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,601
Ronan,

106
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,569
Korath has returned.

107
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,873
Master, he is a thief,

108
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,041
an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord.

109
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,677
But we have discovered
he has an agreement

110
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,580
to retrieve the Orb for
an intermediary known

111
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,215
as The Broker.

112
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:46,752
I promised Thanos I would
retrieve the Orb for him.

113
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,912
Only then will he destroy Xandar for me.

114
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:54,223
Nebula, go to Xandar
and get me the Orb.

115
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:55,694
It will be my honor.

116
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,283
It will be your doom.

117
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,633
If this happens again,
you'll be facing our father

118
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,434
without his prize.

119
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,501
I'm a daughter of Thanos.

120
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:05,738
Just like you.

121
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,173
But I know Xandar.

122
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,941
Ronan has already decreed that I...

123
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,508
Do not speak for me.

124
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:15,012
You will not fail.

125
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,340
Have I ever?

126
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,802
Xandarians.

127
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,104
What a bunch of losers.

128
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:43,776
All of them in a big hurry to
get from something stupid,

129
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,111
to nothing at all. Pathetic.

130
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,179
Look at this guy!

131
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,848
Can you believe they call us criminals,

132
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,283
when he's assaulting
us with that haircut?

133
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:54,153
What is this thing?
Look how it thinks it's so cool.

134
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,857
It's not cool to get help!
Walk by yourself, you little gargoyle.

135
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,357
Look at Mr. Smiles over here.

136
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,722
Where's your wife, old man?
What a class-A prevert.

137
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,866
Right, Groot?

138
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,033
Groot?

139
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,035
Don't drink fountain water, you idiot.

140
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,671
That's disgusting!

141
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,707
Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it.

142
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,399
Why are you lying?

143
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,547
Looks like we got one.

144
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:26,106
Okay, humie, how bad does
someone wanna find you?

145
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:31,783
40,000 units?
Groot, we're gonna be rich.

146
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,066
- Mr. Quill.
- Broker.

147
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,440
The Orb.

148
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,045
- As commissioned.
- Where's Yondu?

149
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,880
Wanted to be here. Sends his love.

150
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,015
And told me to tell you,

151
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,810
that you got the best
eyebrows in the business.

152
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,041
What is it?

153
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:05,691
It's my policy never to discuss
my clients, or their needs.

154
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,826
Yeah, well, I almost
died getting it for you.

155
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:11,327
An occupational hazard,
I'm sure, in your line of work.

156
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,260
Some machine-headed freak,
working for a dude named Ronan.

157
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,169
Ronan? I'm sorry, Mr. Quill.

158
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,270
I truly am.

159
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,533
But I want no part of this
transaction if Ronan is involved.

160
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,276
Who's Ronan?

161
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,613
A Kree fanatic,
outraged by the peace treaty,

162
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:32,051
who will not rest until
Xandarian culture, my culture,

163
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,860
- is wiped from existence!
- Come on.

164
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:36,322
He's someone whose bad
side I'd rather not be on.

165
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,952
- What? What about my bad side?
- Farewell, Mr. Quill.

166
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,660
Hey, we had a deal, bro!

167
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,792
What happened?

168
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:56,203
This guy just backed out of a deal on me.
If there's one thing I hate,

169
00:17:56,304 --> 00:18:00,035
it's a man without integrity.
Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord.

170
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,382
You have the bearing of a man of honor.

171
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,041
Well, you know, I wouldn't say that.

172
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,855
People say it about me, all the time,

173
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:11,622
but it's not something I
would ever say about myself.

174
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,334
This wasn't the plan.

175
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,614
Put him in the bag. Put him in the bag!

176
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:38,017
No! Not her, him!

177
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,016
Learn genders, man.

178
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,547
Biting? That's not fair!

179
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,686
Take it easy!

180
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,657
Fool. You should have learned.

181
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:21,020
I don't learn. One of my issues.

182
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,360
What the...

183
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,733
Quit smiling, you idiot.
You're supposed to be a professional.

184
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,379
You gotta be kidding me.

185
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,344
Hey!

186
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,034
I live for the simple things.

187
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,795
Like how much this is gonna hurt.

188
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,742
Yeah. Writhe, little man.

189
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:14,880
It'll grow back, you d'ast idiot.

190
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,947
Quit whining.

191
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:28,553
Subject 89P13, drop your weapon.

192
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,262
Crap.

193
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,797
By the authority of the Nova Corps,

194
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,699
- you are under arrest...
- All right. Come on up.

195
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,968
...for endangerment to life and
the destruction of property.

196
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,238
Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.

197
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,608
- Star-Lord.
- Sorry. "Lord."

198
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:46,311
I picked this guy up a while back for
petty theft. He's got a code name.

199
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,446
Yeah. Stay out of the way.

200
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,414
Come on, man. It's a...
It's an outlaw name.

201
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,216
Just relax, pal.

202
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,875
It's cool to have a code name.
It's not that weird.

203
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,977
Fascists.

204
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:13,438
Ronan is destroying Xandarian
outposts throughout the galaxy.

205
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:17,406
I should think that would call for some
slight response on the part of the Kree.

206
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,379
We signed your peace treaty, Nova Prime.
What more do you want?

207
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:24,816
At least a statement from the Kree Empire
saying that they condemn his actions.

208
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,921
He is slaughtering children.
Families.

209
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:33,881
That is your business. Now,
I have other matters to attend to.

210
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,327
Prick.

211
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,565
Well, some good news.

212
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:43,101
It looks like we've apprehended
one of Ronan's compatriots.

213
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:47,472
Gamora. Surgically modified and
trained as a living weapon.

214
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:50,409
The adopted daughter of
the Mad Titan, Thanos.

215
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:53,679
Recently, Thanos lent her and
her sister Nebula out to Ronan,

216
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:57,049
which leads us to believe that Thanos
and Ronan are working together.

217
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:01,520
Subject 89P13. Calls itself "Rocket."

218
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,988
The result of illegal genetic

219
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:06,191
and cybernetic experiments
on a lower life form.

220
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,360
What the hell?

221
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,028
They call it "Groot."

222
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:12,598
A humanoid plant that's
been travelling recently

223
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:16,326
as 89P13's personal
houseplantlmuscle.

224
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,172
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra.

225
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,342
Raised from youth by a band of
mercenaries called the Ravagers,

226
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,277
led by Yondu Udonta.

227
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:26,878
I'm sorry.

228
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:29,948
I didn't know how this machine worked.

229
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,551
What a bunch of a-holes.

230
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,585
Transport all four to the Kyln.

231
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:41,393
I guess most of Nova Corps
wanna uphold the laws,

232
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:45,063
but these ones here,
they're corrupt and cruel.

233
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:49,034
But, hey, that's not my problem.
I ain't gonna be here long.

234
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:52,604
I've escaped 22 prisons.
This one's no different.

235
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,274
You're lucky the broad showed up,
because otherwise, me and Groot

236
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,209
would be collecting
that bounty right now,

237
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,345
and you'd be getting drawn and
quartered by Yondu and those Ravagers.

238
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,581
I've had a lot of folks try
to kill me over the years.

239
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,484
I ain't about to be brought down
by a tree and a talking raccoon.

240
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:06,652
Hold.

241
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,654
- What's a raccoon?
- "What's a raccoon?"

242
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,055
It's what you are, stupid.

243
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:13,191
Ain't no thing like me, except me.

244
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,861
So, this Orb has a real
shiny blue suitcase,

245
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:19,453
Ark of the Covenant,
Maltese Falcon sort of vibe.

246
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:20,999
- What is it?
- I am Groot.

247
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,768
So what? What's the Orb?

248
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,070
I have no words for an honorless thief.

249
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,674
Pretty high and mighty coming from
the lackey of a genocidal maniac.

250
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,642
Yeah, I know who you are.

251
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:34,413
- Anyone who's anyone knows who you are.
- Yeah, we know who you are.

252
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:37,015
- Who is she?
- I am Groot.

253
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,515
Yeah, you said that.

254
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:44,122
I wasn't retrieving the Orb
for Ronan. I was betraying him.

255
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,690
I had an agreement to
sell it to a third party.

256
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,594
I am Groot.

257
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:53,932
Well, that's just as fascinating as
the first 89 times you told me that.

258
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:56,201
What is wrong with Giving Tree, here?

259
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,503
Well, he don't know talking
good like me and you.

260
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:02,674
So his vocabulistics is limited
to "I" and "am" and "Groot."

261
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,476
Exclusively in that order.

262
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,271
I tell you what, that's gonna
wear real thin, real fast.

263
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,072
Hey. Put that away.

264
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,018
Hey!

265
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,454
Listen to me, you big blue bastard.
Take those headphones off.

266
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:19,652
That's mine. Those belong to impound.
That tape and that player is mine!

267
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:27,764
Hooked on a Feeling, Blue Swede, 1973.
That song belongs to me!

268
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:50,348
- You first! You first!
- Murderer!

269
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,984
Coming for you first, Gamora!
You're dead!

270
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:57,782
You're scum! You're scum!

271
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,493
It's like I said,

272
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,428
she's got a rep.

273
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,497
A lot of prisoners here
have lost their families

274
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,666
to Ronan and his goons.

275
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,034
She'll last a day, tops.

276
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,702
Murderer!

277
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,337
The guards will protect her, right?

278
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:14,706
They're here to stop us from getting out.

279
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,775
They don't care what we
do to each other inside.

280
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:20,412
Whatever nightmares the future holds,

281
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:24,607
are dreams compared
to what's behind me.

282
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:28,086
Check out the new meat.

283
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:31,923
I'm gonna slather you
up in Gunavian jelly,

284
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,785
and go to town...

285
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:40,192
Let's make something clear.

286
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:44,425
This one here is our booty!

287
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,933
You wanna get to him,

288
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,267
you go through us!

289
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,310
Or, more accurately,

290
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,310
we go through you.

291
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,119
I'm with them.

292
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,318
I hate you.

293
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:13,653
No cell's gonna protect you for long.

294
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:27,401
You're dead!

295
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:28,979
Dead!

296
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,541
Take her down to the showers.

297
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:59,939
It'll be easier to clean
up the blood down there.

298
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,919
Quill, where you going?

299
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,282
Quill.

300
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,195
Quill!

301
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,233
Gamora, consider this a death sentence

302
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,469
for your crimes against the galaxy.

303
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,229
You dare?

304
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:34,274
You know who I am, yes?

305
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:35,880
You're Drax.

306
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,116
The Destroyer.

307
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,217
Quill!

308
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,286
And you know why they call me this.

309
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,411
You slayed dozens of Ronan's minions.

310
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:47,892
Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette,

311
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,426
and my daughter, Camaria.

312
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:52,991
He slaughtered them where they stood.

313
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:55,266
And he laughed!

314
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:56,334
Quill?

315
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:57,992
Her life

316
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,770
is not yours to take.

317
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:04,764
He killed my family.

318
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,635
I shall kill one of his in return.

319
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:10,106
Of course, Drax. Here, I...

320
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,352
Quill! What are you doing?

321
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:22,153
I'm no family to Ronan or Thanos.

322
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,463
I'm your only hope at stopping him.

323
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,709
Woman, your words mean nothing to me!

324
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,345
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- Crap.

325
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,614
You know, if killing Ronan
is truly your sole purpose,

326
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,511
I don't think this is the
best way to go about it.

327
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:47,852
Are you not the man this
wench attempted to kill?

328
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,321
Well, I mean, she's hardly the first
woman to try and do that to me.

329
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:53,992
Look, this is from a
smoking-hot Rajak girl.

330
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:57,328
Stabbed me with a fork. Didn't like
me skipping out on her at sunrise.

331
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,998
I got, right here, a Kree girl
tried to rip out my thorax.

332
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:03,268
She caught me with this skinny little
A'askavariian who worked in Nova Records.

333
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:06,771
I was trying to get information.
You ever see an A'askavariian?

334
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:08,740
They have tentacles,
and needles for teeth.

335
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,535
If you think I'm seriously
interested in that, then...

336
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:15,068
You don't care. But here's the point.

337
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:19,612
She betrayed Ronan.
He's coming back for her.

338
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,410
And when he does,

339
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,850
that's when you...

340
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:27,358
Why would I put my
finger on his throat?

341
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,982
What?

342
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:31,796
No, it's a symbol.

343
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:36,568
This is a symbol for
you slicing his throat.

344
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,636
I would not slice his throat.

345
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:41,506
I would cut his head clean off.

346
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,708
It's a general expression
for you killing somebody.

347
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:45,343
You've heard of this.
You've seen this, right?

348
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:46,878
- You know what that is.
- Yeah. Yeah.

349
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,105
- Everyone knows.
- No, no.

350
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:54,217
What I'm saying is,
you want to keep her alive.

351
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:57,284
Don't do his work for him.

352
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,669
I like your knife. I'm keeping it.

353
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:15,507
- That was my favorite knife.
- Listen!

354
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:18,743
I could care less whether
you live or whether you die.

355
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:22,005
- Then why stop the big guy?
- Simple.

356
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:23,414
You know where to sell my Orb.

357
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:26,209
How are we gonna sell it
when we and it are still here?

358
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,509
My friend Rocket, here,

359
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,382
has escaped 22 prisons.

360
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,723
We're getting out.

361
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:34,793
And then we're headed straight
to Yondu to retrieve your bounty.

362
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:38,988
How much was your buyer
willing to pay you for my Orb?

363
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,166
Four billion units.

364
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,101
- What?
- Holy shit.

365
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:47,228
That Orb is my opportunity to
get away from Thanos and Ronan.

366
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,164
If you free us,

367
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:53,945
I'll lead you to the buyer directly and I'll
split the profit between the three of us.

368
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,114
I am Groot.

369
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,282
Four of us.

370
00:31:57,382 --> 00:32:00,951
Asleep for the danger, awake for
the money, as per frickin' usual.

371
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,323
You have been betrayed, Ronan.

372
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,550
We know only that
she has been captured.

373
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,161
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.

374
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:14,699
No! Our sources within the Kyln say
Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.

375
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,402
Look, your partnership with Thanos

376
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,697
is at risk.

377
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:24,198
Thanos requires your presence. Now!

378
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:33,351
With all due respect, Thanos,
your daughter made this mess,

379
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,953
and yet you summon me.

380
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,955
I would lower my voice, Accuser.

381
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,123
First, she lost a battle
with some primitive.

382
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,092
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.

383
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:43,962
Then she was apprehended
by the Nova Corps.

384
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,864
You are the one here with
nothing to show for it.

385
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:50,068
Your sources say that she meant
to betray us the whole time!

386
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,502
Lower your tone!

387
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,069
I may be your...

388
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:05,180
I only ask that you take
this matter seriously.

389
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:09,854
The only matter I do not
take seriously, boy,

390
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:11,682
is you.

391
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:14,525
Your politics bore me.

392
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,695
Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.

393
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:22,959
And, apparently, you alienated
my favorite daughter, Gamora.

394
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,039
I shall honor our agreement, Kree,

395
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,402
if you bring me the Orb.

396
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,833
But return to me again empty-handed,

397
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:37,312
and I will bathe the
starways in your blood.

398
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,549
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.

399
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:47,585
This is one fight you won't win.

400
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,487
Let's head to the Kyln.

401
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:01,673
If we're gonna get out of here, we're
gonna need to get into that watchtower.

402
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,900
And to do that,
I'm gonna need a few things.

403
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:08,980
The guards wear security bands to
control their ins and outs. I need one.

404
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,515
Leave it to me.

405
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:13,418
That dude, there.
I need his prosthetic leg.

406
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,253
- His leg?
- Yeah.

407
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,855
God knows I don't need the rest of him.
Look at him, he's useless.

408
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:18,957
All right.

409
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:23,361
And finally, on the wall back there
is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.

410
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,430
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

411
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:29,667
There's a quarnyx battery behind it.
Purplish box, green wires.

412
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,903
To get into that watchtower,
I definitely need it.

413
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:33,404
How are we supposed to do that?

414
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,773
Well, supposably,
these bald-bodies find you attractive.

415
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,508
So, maybe you can work
out some sort of trade.

416
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:38,743
You must be joking.

417
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:40,611
No, I really heard they
find you attractive.

418
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:42,313
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,

419
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,816
and it's in the middle of the most
heavily-guarded part of the prison.

420
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,685
It's impossible to get up
there without being seen.

421
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:50,989
I got one plan, and that plan
requires a frickin' quarnyx battery,

422
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,681
so figure it out!

423
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,526
Can I get back to it? Thanks.

424
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:59,197
Now, this is important.
Once the battery is removed,

425
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,666
everything is gonna slam
into emergency mode.

426
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:07,902
Once we have it, we gotta move quickly,
so you definitely need to get that last.

427
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,279
Or we could just get
it first and improvise.

428
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,904
- I'll get the armband.
- Leg.

429
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,598
Prisoner, drop the device immediately
and retreat to your cell,

430
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:36,029
or we will open fire.

431
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,741
I am

432
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,611
Groot!

433
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,542
Fire!

434
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,456
All prisoners return to
your sleeping areas.

435
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,001
You idiot!

436
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:13,297
How am I supposed to fight
these things without my stuff?

437
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,711
The animal is in control.

438
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:23,245
Fire on my command!

439
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,065
Creepy little beast!

440
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:53,667
Oh, yeah.

441
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,452
You need my what?

442
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,742
- I'll need this.
- Good luck.

443
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,277
It's internally wired.

444
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,469
I'll figure something out.

445
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,117
Drop the leg!

446
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:36,277
Drop the leg and move
back to your cell!

447
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,532
Rocket!

448
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:57,704
Move to the watchtower!

449
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,728
You!

450
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:32,332
Man who has lain with an A'askavariian!

451
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:35,836
It was one time, man.

452
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:40,172
We need all available guards
in full combat gear...

453
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,039
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.

454
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,198
Why is this one here?

455
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,846
We promised him he could stay by
your side until he kills your boss.

456
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:11,882
I always keep my promises,
when they're to muscle-bound whack-jobs

457
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,710
who will kill me if I don't. Here you go.

458
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,854
I was just kidding about the leg.
I just need these two things.

459
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,656
- What?
- No, I thought it'd be funny.

460
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:21,659
Was it funny? Wait, what did
he look like hopping around?

461
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:24,159
I had to transfer him 30,000 units!

462
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,155
How are we going to leave?

463
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,137
Well, he's got a plan. Right?
Or is that another thing you made up?

464
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,839
I have a plan! I have a plan!

465
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:38,276
Cease your yammering and relieve
us from this irksome confinement.

466
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,646
Yeah, I'll have to agree with the
walking thesaurus on that one.

467
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:44,680
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.

468
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:46,117
It's just a metaphor, dude.

469
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,086
His people are completely literal.
Metaphors are gonna go over his head.

470
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,888
Nothing goes over my head.

471
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:54,548
My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.

472
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:59,025
I'm gonna die surrounded by
the biggest idiots in the galaxy.

473
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,564
Those are some big guns.

474
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,031
On my command!

475
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:10,974
Number one!

476
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:15,339
- Rodent, we are ready for your plan.
- Hold on!

477
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,676
Number two!

478
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:23,220
I recognize this animal. We'd roast
them over a flame pit as children.

479
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,923
- Their flesh was quite delicious.
- Not helping!

480
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,490
Number three!

481
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:36,233
All fire on my command!

482
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,802
Three!

483
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,437
Two!

484
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,163
One!

485
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:56,921
He turned off the artificial gravity,

486
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,455
everywhere but in here.

487
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:40,060
I told you I had a plan.

488
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:04,014
That was a pretty good plan.

489
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,400
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship.

490
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,170
It's the Milano, the orange and
blue one over in the corner.

491
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,071
They crumpled my pants up into a ball.

492
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:23,639
That's rude! They folded yours.

493
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,484
The Orb's there. Let's go.

494
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:36,153
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

495
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:38,322
That bastard didn't put it back.

496
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:41,025
- Put what back?
- Here.

497
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,827
Get them to the ship. I will be right back.

498
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:45,496
- How are you gonna possibly...
- Just keep the Milano close by.

499
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:46,931
Go.

500
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,759
Go!

501
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,917
My neck!

502
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:16,760
Well, how's he gonna get to us?

503
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,796
He declined to share that
information with me.

504
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:20,363
Well, screw this, then!

505
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:24,268
I ain't waiting around for some humie with
a death wish. You got the Orb, right?

506
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,426
Yes.

507
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:51,295
If we don't leave now,
we will be blown to bits.

508
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:52,363
No!

509
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,931
We're not leaving without the Orb.

510
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:04,869
Behold.

511
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,018
This one shows spirit.

512
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:17,054
He shall make a keen ally in
the battle against Ronan.

513
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,088
Companion, what were you retrieving?

514
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:27,786
You're an imbecile.

515
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,476
Yo, Ranger Rick! What are you doing?

516
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:42,179
You can't take apart my
ship without asking me!

517
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:44,114
- See, what is this?
- Don't touch that!

518
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:45,182
It's a bomb.

519
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:46,350
- A bomb?
- Yup.

520
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,152
And you leave it lying around?

521
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,853
I was gonna put it in a box.

522
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:51,055
What's a box gonna do?

523
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:53,357
- How about this one?
- No! Hey!

524
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:54,458
- Leave it alone.
- Why? What is it?

525
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:56,525
- Shut up.
- Hey!

526
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:58,429
What is that?

527
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,632
That's for if things get really hardcore.

528
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:02,967
Or if you wanna blow up moons.

529
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:04,602
No one's blowing up moons.

530
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,870
You just wanna suck the
joy out of everything.

531
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:09,495
So, listen, I'm gonna need
your buyer's coordinates.

532
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:12,376
We're heading in the
right direction. For now.

533
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:15,012
If we're gonna work together,
you might try trusting me a little bit.

534
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:16,614
And how much do you trust me?

535
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,149
I'd trust you a lot more if
you told me what this was.

536
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:23,587
Because I'm guessing it's
some kind of weapon.

537
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:24,989
I don't know what it is.

538
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:27,424
If it's a weapon, we should
use it against Ronan.

539
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:29,460
Put it down, you fool.
You'll destroy us all.

540
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,628
Or just you, murderess!

541
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,396
I let you live once, princess!

542
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:34,598
- I am not a princess!
- Hey!

543
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:38,725
Nobody is killing anybody on my ship!

544
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:42,573
We're stuck together
until we get the money.

545
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,875
I have no interest in money.

546
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:46,669
Great.

547
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:51,071
That means more money
for the three of us.

548
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:56,453
For the four of us. Partners.

549
00:45:56,553 --> 00:46:00,246
We have an agreement, but I would
never be partners with the likes of you.

550
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,818
I'll tell the buyer we're on our way.

551
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:07,157
And Quill, your ship is filthy.

552
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,325
She has no idea.

553
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,439
If I had a black light,

554
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:18,507
the place would look like a
Jackson Pollock painting.

555
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:20,836
You got issues, Quill.

556
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:32,179
I swear. I don't know where
they went! I swear.

557
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:35,159
If he knew where they were headed,
he would have already told us.

558
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:36,694
Yeah.

559
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:41,031
Ronan, the Nova Corps sent a
fleet to defend the prison.

560
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:45,569
Well, then, send Necrocraft to
every corner of the quadrant.

561
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:49,139
Find the Orb. Any means, any price.

562
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:52,741
- And this place?
- The Nova can't know what we're after.

563
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:56,142
Cleanse it!

564
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,984
Do you got any other cute
little buggers like this one?

565
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:05,089
I like to stick 'em all in a
row on my control console.

566
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:07,291
I can't tell if you're joking or not.

567
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:09,526
He's being fully serious.

568
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:12,321
In that case, I can show you...

569
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,798
But first, you gonna tell
me what this Orb is,

570
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:17,559
and why everybody cares
so damn much about it.

571
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,503
And then you gonna tell me,

572
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:21,739
who out there might wanna buy it.

573
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,001
Sir, the high-end community is a...

574
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,343
The high-end community is a...

575
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,081
It's a tight-knit...

576
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,449
Tight-knit...

577
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:34,744
The high-end community
is a very tight-knit...

578
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,354
I cannot possibly betray

579
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:39,615
the confidentiality of my buyers!

580
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:53,166
Now, who again is this buyer of yours?

581
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,741
Carina.

582
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:58,976
Yes, Master.

583
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:02,513
Your people do have elbows,
do they not?

584
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:04,047
We do, Master.

585
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:07,582
Then use them.

586
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:09,820
I don't have to remind you

587
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,390
what happened to the last
attendant who disappointed me.

588
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,389
Do I?

589
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:22,226
Chop, chop. Our guests
will be here soon.

590
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:28,595
Heads up! We're inbound.

591
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:49,013
What is it?

592
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,562
It's called Knowhere.

593
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:54,932
The severed head of an
ancient celestial being.

594
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:57,295
Be wary headed in, rodent.

595
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:01,629
There are no regulations
whatsoever here.

596
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:28,365
Hundreds of years ago,
the Tivan Group sent workers in

597
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:31,034
to mine the organic
matter within the skull.

598
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,437
Bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid.

599
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:38,642
All rare resources, highly valued
in black markets across the galaxy.

600
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:42,379
It's dangerous and illegal work,
suitable only for outlaws.

601
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,674
Well, I come from a planet of outlaws.

602
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:48,151
Billy the Kid, Bonnie
and Clyde, John Stamos.

603
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:49,753
It sounds like a place,
which I would like to visit.

604
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:51,342
Yeah, you should.

605
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,357
Excuse me.

606
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:56,289
- Watch your wallets.
- Can you spare any units?

607
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:05,358
Get out of here.

608
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:12,476
Your buyer's in there?

609
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:14,478
We are to wait here
for his representative.

610
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:16,079
Get out of here!

611
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,415
This is no respectable establishment.

612
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,040
What do you expect
us to do while we wait?

613
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,944
Yes! Yes!

614
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:34,395
Yahoo!

615
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:42,739
My Orloni has won,

616
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:45,102
as I won at all things!

617
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:48,045
Now, let's put more of
this liquid into our bodies.

618
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:52,513
That's the first thing you said
that wasn't bat-shit crazy!

619
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,519
Man, you wouldn't believe what
they charge for fuel out here.

620
00:50:55,619 --> 00:51:00,057
- I might actually lose money on this job.
- My connection is making us wait.

621
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:04,194
It's just a negotiation tactic.
Trust me, this is my specialty.

622
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:09,626
Where yours is more,
"Stab, stab. Those are my terms."

623
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,559
- My father didn't stress diplomacy.
- Thanos?

624
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:16,668
He's not my father.

625
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:21,739
When Thanos took my home world,
he killed my parents in front of me.

626
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:26,683
He tortured me,
turned me into a weapon.

627
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:30,821
When he said he was going to destroy
an entire planet for Ronan,

628
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,355
I couldn't stand by and...

629
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:40,228
Why would you risk your life for this?

630
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,889
My mother gave it to me.

631
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:48,205
My mom liked sharing with me all the
pop songs that she loved growing up.

632
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:49,673
I happened to have it on me,

633
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,104
when I was...

634
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:54,672
The day that she...

635
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,842
You know, when I left Earth.

636
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,584
What do you do with it?

637
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:04,421
Do? Nothing. You listen to it.
Or you can dance.

638
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:09,192
I'm a warrior and an assassin.
I do not dance.

639
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,560
Really?

640
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:14,865
On my planet, there's a
legend about people like you.

641
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,500
It's called

642
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,901
Footloose.

643
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:22,072
And in it, a great hero

644
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:23,900
named Kevin Bacon,

645
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:29,505
teaches an entire city full of people with
sticks up their butts that dancing, well...

646
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:32,612
It's the greatest thing there is.

647
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:34,651
Who put the sticks up their butts?

648
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:36,219
What? No, that's just a...

649
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,188
- That is cruel.
- It's just a phrase

650
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,949
people use.

651
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,670
The melody is pleasant!

652
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:20,530
- No!
- What the hell?

653
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,032
I know who you are, Peter Quill!

654
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:25,435
And I am not some starry-eyed
waif here to succumb to your...

655
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,737
Your pelvic sorcery!

656
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:29,702
That is not what is happening here.

657
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:36,642
No.

658
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:47,057
Stop it!

659
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:48,492
What are you doing?

660
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:51,728
This vermin speaks of affairs
he knows nothing about!

661
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:53,797
- That is true!
- He has no respect!

662
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:56,299
- That is also true!
- Hold on! Hold on!

663
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,568
Keep calling me vermin, tough guy!

664
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:00,737
You just wanna laugh at
me like everyone else!

665
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:03,440
Rocket, you're drunk. All right?
No one's laughing at you.

666
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,309
He thinks I'm some
stupid thing! He does!

667
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,812
Well, I didn't ask to get made!

668
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,981
I didn't ask to be torn apart,

669
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,083
and put back together, over and over

670
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,452
and turned into some...

671
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:16,620
Some little monster!

672
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,688
Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.

673
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:20,957
He called me "vermin"!

674
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:23,727
She called me "rodent"!

675
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:25,162
Let's see if you can laugh

676
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,398
after five or six good shots
to your frickin' face!

677
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:32,302
No, no, no, no!
Four billion units! Rocket!

678
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:36,696
Come on, man. Hey! Suck it up for one
more lousy night and you're rich.

679
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:47,231
Fine. But I can't promise,

680
00:54:47,332 --> 00:54:49,886
when all this is over I'm not gonna
kill every last one of you jerks.

681
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:53,944
See? That's exactly why none
of you have any friends!

682
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,726
Five seconds after you meet somebody,
you're already trying to kill them!

683
00:54:56,826 --> 00:55:00,830
We have travelled,
halfway across the quadrant.

684
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:03,398
And Ronan is no closer to being dead.

685
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,437
- Drax!
- Let him go.

686
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:09,197
We don't need him.

687
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,243
Milady Gamora.

688
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:15,606
I'm here to fetch you for my master.

689
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,753
Okay, this isn't creepy at all.

690
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:27,151
We house the galaxy's
largest collection

691
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:30,290
of fauna, relics,
and species of all manner.

692
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,101
I present to you,

693
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:42,296
Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.

694
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:58,245
Oh, my dear Gamora.

695
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:01,091
How wonderful to meet in the flesh.

696
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:04,094
Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan.

697
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:07,128
We have what we discussed.

698
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:12,235
What is that thing there?

699
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:14,496
I am Groot.

700
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:19,843
I never thought I'd meet a Groot.

701
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:21,842
Sir...

702
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:25,415
You must allow me to pay you now
so that I may own your carcass.

703
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:28,451
At the moment of your death, of course.

704
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:29,853
I am Groot.

705
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:32,722
Why, so he could turn
you into a frickin' chair?

706
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:34,289
That's your pet?

707
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:37,250
- His what?
- Tivan.

708
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:41,231
We have been halfway around
the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.

709
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,433
Very well, then.

710
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:46,501
Let us see what you brought.

711
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:02,510
Three quarnyx batteries,
seven cases of Cotati seeds.

712
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:06,409
No, cases. Last time, you sent me...

713
00:57:07,548 --> 00:57:10,785
You shall send a message for me.

714
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:12,818
Oh, my new friends.

715
00:57:13,687 --> 00:57:16,891
Before creation itself,

716
00:57:16,991 --> 00:57:19,152
there were six singularities.

717
00:57:20,961 --> 00:57:24,732
Then the universe
exploded into existence,

718
00:57:24,832 --> 00:57:26,934
and the remnants of these systems

719
00:57:27,034 --> 00:57:30,935
were forged into concentrated ingots.

720
00:57:31,205 --> 00:57:33,969
Infinity Stones.

721
00:57:34,675 --> 00:57:36,210
These stones, it seems,

722
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,179
can only be brandished

723
00:57:38,279 --> 00:57:41,816
by beings of extraordinary strength.

724
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:43,405
Observe.

725
00:57:46,187 --> 00:57:51,993
These carriers can use the Stone
to mow down entire civilizations

726
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:56,051
like wheat in a field.

727
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,828
There's a little pee coming
out of me right now.

728
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:01,469
Once, for a moment,

729
00:58:01,569 --> 00:58:05,673
a group was able to share the
energy amongst themselves,

730
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:09,208
but even they were
quickly destroyed by it.

731
00:58:14,915 --> 00:58:17,076
Beautiful.

732
00:58:18,419 --> 00:58:21,353
Beyond compare.

733
00:58:23,057 --> 00:58:27,186
We're all very fascinated, whitey.
But we'd like to get paid.

734
00:58:28,629 --> 00:58:30,097
How would you like to get paid?

735
00:58:30,197 --> 00:58:32,688
What do you think, fancy man? Units!

736
00:58:33,667 --> 00:58:35,225
Very well, then.

737
00:58:40,374 --> 00:58:41,976
Carina.

738
00:58:42,076 --> 00:58:43,543
Stand back.

739
00:58:43,711 --> 00:58:46,414
I will no longer be your slave!

740
00:58:46,514 --> 00:58:48,447
No!

741
00:59:35,296 --> 00:59:36,820
What the...

742
00:59:45,807 --> 00:59:48,609
How could I think Tivan could contain
whatever was within the Orb?

743
00:59:48,709 --> 00:59:52,213
- What do you still have it for?
- What are we gonna do, leave it in there?

744
00:59:52,313 --> 00:59:56,183
- I can't believe you had that in your purse!
- It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!

745
00:59:56,283 --> 00:59:59,954
We have to bring this to the Nova Corps.
There's a chance they can contain it.

746
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:02,858
Are you kidding me?
We're wanted by the Nova Corps.

747
01:00:02,959 --> 01:00:05,493
- Just give it to Ronan!
- So he can destroy the galaxy?

748
01:00:05,593 --> 01:00:07,394
What are you,
some saint all of a sudden?

749
01:00:07,494 --> 01:00:10,498
What has the galaxy ever done for you?
Why would you wanna save it?

750
01:00:10,598 --> 01:00:12,399
Because I'm one of the
idiots who lives in it!

751
01:00:12,499 --> 01:00:17,271
Peter, listen to me. We cannot allow
the Stone to fall into Ronan's hands.

752
01:00:17,371 --> 01:00:20,708
We have to go back to your
ship, and deliver it to Nova.

753
01:00:20,808 --> 01:00:23,640
Right, right, okay. I think you're right.

754
01:00:23,978 --> 01:00:27,948
Or we could give it to somebody
who's not going to arrest us,

755
01:00:28,048 --> 01:00:31,218
who's really nice for
a whole lot of money.

756
01:00:31,318 --> 01:00:33,854
I think it's a really good balance
between both of your points of view.

757
01:00:33,954 --> 01:00:37,123
You're despicable. Dishonorable.

758
01:00:37,291 --> 01:00:38,758
Faithless!

759
01:00:39,026 --> 01:00:41,016
- No.
- At last!

760
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:45,666
I shall meet my foe and destroy him.

761
01:00:45,766 --> 01:00:47,927
You called Ronan?

762
01:00:52,339 --> 01:00:55,831
Quill! Don't you move, boy!

763
01:00:56,543 --> 01:00:59,102
Don't you move! Get out of the way!

764
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:04,985
Ronan the Accuser!

765
01:01:05,085 --> 01:01:07,621
You are the one who
transmitted the message?

766
01:01:07,721 --> 01:01:09,483
You killed my wife.

767
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:12,220
You killed my daughter!

768
01:01:19,266 --> 01:01:23,532
I told you, you can't fit.
Now, wait here. I'll be back.

769
01:01:28,709 --> 01:01:32,508
It is Gamora. She is
escaping with the Orb.

770
01:01:40,821 --> 01:01:42,489
No!

771
01:01:42,589 --> 01:01:44,056
Nebula,

772
01:01:44,425 --> 01:01:46,517
retrieve the Orb.

773
01:02:02,576 --> 01:02:04,941
The Stone is in the furthest pod.

774
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:06,907
Bring it down!

775
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:38,245
Rocket, keep them off Gamora
until she gets to the Milano.

776
01:02:38,345 --> 01:02:40,781
How? We've got no
weaponry on these things.

777
01:02:40,881 --> 01:02:42,716
These pods are industrial grade.

778
01:02:42,816 --> 01:02:44,018
They're nearly indestructible.

779
01:02:44,118 --> 01:02:46,720
Not against necroblasts, they're not.

780
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:48,844
That's not what I'm saying.

781
01:03:36,904 --> 01:03:39,031
Let me borrow your ride.

782
01:04:11,371 --> 01:04:13,634
I don't recall killing your family.

783
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:20,344
I doubt I'll remember killing you, either.

784
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:39,795
Quill, I'm trapped.
I can't make it to the Milano.

785
01:04:39,967 --> 01:04:41,434
I have to head out.

786
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:45,904
Wait! These things aren't
meant to go out there.

787
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:54,810
You are a disappointment, sister.

788
01:04:55,148 --> 01:04:57,548
Of all our siblings,

789
01:04:57,918 --> 01:04:59,820
I hated you least.

790
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,188
Nebula, please.

791
01:05:01,288 --> 01:05:03,223
If Ronan gets this stone

792
01:05:03,323 --> 01:05:05,518
- he'll kill us all.
- Not all.

793
01:05:06,793 --> 01:05:08,920
You will already be dead.

794
01:06:02,983 --> 01:06:06,418
Ronan, it is done.

795
01:06:09,022 --> 01:06:10,511
Quill, come on.

796
01:06:10,624 --> 01:06:13,160
Her body mods should keep her
alive a couple more minutes,

797
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,329
but there's nothing we can do for her.

798
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:16,997
These pods aren't
meant to be out here.

799
01:06:17,097 --> 01:06:19,963
In a second, we're gonna
be in the same boat.

800
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:29,770
Damn it.

801
01:06:30,644 --> 01:06:32,145
Quill?

802
01:06:32,245 --> 01:06:34,281
Yondu! Yondu.

803
01:06:34,381 --> 01:06:35,415
This is Quill!

804
01:06:35,515 --> 01:06:39,186
- My coordinates are 227 K324.
- Quill.

805
01:06:39,286 --> 01:06:40,521
Quill, what are you doing?

806
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:42,122
Just outside Knowhere.

807
01:06:42,222 --> 01:06:44,815
If you're there, come get me.

808
01:06:45,058 --> 01:06:47,025
I'm all yours.

809
01:06:56,003 --> 01:06:58,437
Quill, don't be ridiculous.

810
01:06:59,573 --> 01:07:01,975
Get back into your pod!

811
01:07:02,075 --> 01:07:05,601
You can't fit two people in there.
You're gonna die.

812
01:07:06,346 --> 01:07:08,448
You'll die in seconds!

813
01:07:08,548 --> 01:07:10,140
Quill.

814
01:08:10,744 --> 01:08:12,905
Quill?

815
01:08:14,081 --> 01:08:16,014
What happened?

816
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:19,208
I saw you out there.

817
01:08:20,187 --> 01:08:23,121
I don't know what came over me.

818
01:08:23,623 --> 01:08:25,886
But I couldn't let you die.

819
01:08:28,261 --> 01:08:31,161
I found something inside of myself.

820
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:33,367
Something

821
01:08:33,467 --> 01:08:35,867
incredibly heroic.

822
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:39,773
I mean, not to brag,

823
01:08:39,873 --> 01:08:41,141
but, objectively...

824
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:42,730
Where's the Orb?

825
01:08:44,144 --> 01:08:46,446
It's... Well, they got the Orb.

826
01:08:46,546 --> 01:08:48,035
What?

827
01:08:50,317 --> 01:08:53,217
Welcome home, Peter.

828
01:09:15,642 --> 01:09:18,872
Blasted idiot. They're all idiots!

829
01:09:19,746 --> 01:09:22,049
Quill just got himself captured.

830
01:09:22,149 --> 01:09:26,520
None of this ever would have happened
if you didn't try to single-handedly

831
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:28,314
take on a frickin' army!

832
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:31,283
You're right.

833
01:09:33,527 --> 01:09:36,086
I was a fool.

834
01:09:38,098 --> 01:09:40,259
All the anger,

835
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:42,764
all the rage,

836
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:48,236
was just to cover my loss.

837
01:09:56,383 --> 01:09:59,181
"My wife and child are dead."

838
01:10:00,253 --> 01:10:02,522
I don't care if it's mean!

839
01:10:02,622 --> 01:10:04,953
Everybody's got dead people.

840
01:10:05,158 --> 01:10:06,893
It's no excuse to get everybody else

841
01:10:06,993 --> 01:10:09,358
dead along the way!

842
01:10:12,732 --> 01:10:15,469
Come on, Groot. Ronan has the Stone.

843
01:10:15,569 --> 01:10:18,772
The only chance we got is to get
to the other side of the universe

844
01:10:18,872 --> 01:10:20,841
as fast as we can and maybe,

845
01:10:20,941 --> 01:10:26,037
just maybe, we'll be able to live full lives
before that whack-job ever gets there.

846
01:10:28,048 --> 01:10:29,449
I am Groot.

847
01:10:29,549 --> 01:10:31,918
Save them? How?

848
01:10:32,018 --> 01:10:34,855
I am Groot.

849
01:10:34,955 --> 01:10:37,591
I know they're the only
friends that we ever had,

850
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:40,494
but there's an army of
Ravagers around them.

851
01:10:40,594 --> 01:10:42,652
And there's only two of us!

852
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:44,958
Three.

853
01:10:53,573 --> 01:10:55,876
You're making me

854
01:10:55,976 --> 01:10:57,611
beat... up

855
01:10:57,711 --> 01:10:59,178
grass!

856
01:11:01,248 --> 01:11:03,443
The Orb is in my possession,

857
01:11:04,084 --> 01:11:05,652
as I promised.

858
01:11:05,752 --> 01:11:07,387
Bring it to me.

859
01:11:07,487 --> 01:11:11,252
Yes, that was our agreement.

860
01:11:11,524 --> 01:11:13,260
Bring you the Orb,

861
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:16,963
and you will destroy Xandar for me.

862
01:11:17,063 --> 01:11:21,668
However, now that I know
it contains an Infinity Stone,

863
01:11:21,768 --> 01:11:23,870
I wonder what use I have for you.

864
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:25,705
Boy,

865
01:11:25,805 --> 01:11:28,671
I would reconsider your current course.

866
01:11:29,376 --> 01:11:31,711
Master! You cannot!

867
01:11:31,811 --> 01:11:34,779
Thanos is the most powerful
being in the universe.

868
01:11:34,915 --> 01:11:37,042
Not anymore.

869
01:11:59,406 --> 01:12:01,741
You call me "boy!"

870
01:12:01,841 --> 01:12:06,446
I will unfurl 1,000 years
of Kree justice on Xandar,

871
01:12:06,546 --> 01:12:10,116
and burn it to its core!

872
01:12:10,216 --> 01:12:12,219
Then, Thanos,

873
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:14,753
I am coming for you.

874
01:12:16,656 --> 01:12:19,960
After Xandar, you are
going to kill my father?

875
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:21,962
You dare to oppose me?

876
01:12:22,062 --> 01:12:23,864
You see what he has turned me into.

877
01:12:23,964 --> 01:12:28,696
If you kill him, I will help you
destroy a thousand planets.

878
01:12:29,002 --> 01:12:30,969
You betray me?

879
01:12:31,438 --> 01:12:32,472
Steal my money?

880
01:12:32,572 --> 01:12:34,474
Stop it! Leave him alone!

881
01:12:34,574 --> 01:12:36,710
When I picked you up as a kid,

882
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:39,212
these boys wanted to eat you.

883
01:12:39,312 --> 01:12:41,815
They ain't never tasted Terran before.

884
01:12:41,915 --> 01:12:43,583
I saved your life!

885
01:12:43,683 --> 01:12:45,919
Will you shut up about that? God!

886
01:12:46,019 --> 01:12:48,321
Twenty years, you been
throwing that in my face,

887
01:12:48,421 --> 01:12:51,124
like it's some great thing, not eating me.

888
01:12:51,224 --> 01:12:54,861
Normal people don't even think
about eating someone else!

889
01:12:54,961 --> 01:12:57,497
Much less that person
having to be grateful for it!

890
01:12:57,597 --> 01:12:59,155
You abducted me, man.

891
01:12:59,733 --> 01:13:02,035
You stole me from my
home and from my family.

892
01:13:02,135 --> 01:13:04,671
You don't give a damn
about your Terra!

893
01:13:04,771 --> 01:13:05,839
You're scared

894
01:13:05,939 --> 01:13:08,041
because you're soft in here.

895
01:13:08,141 --> 01:13:09,476
Here, right here!

896
01:13:09,576 --> 01:13:10,644
Yondu!

897
01:13:10,744 --> 01:13:11,945
Listen to me.

898
01:13:12,045 --> 01:13:14,281
Ronan has something
called an Infinity Stone.

899
01:13:14,381 --> 01:13:16,316
I know what he's got, girl.

900
01:13:16,416 --> 01:13:18,752
Then you know we must get it back!

901
01:13:18,852 --> 01:13:22,322
He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.

902
01:13:22,422 --> 01:13:25,425
We have to warn them.
Billions of people will perish.

903
01:13:25,525 --> 01:13:28,161
Is that what she's been
filling your head with, boy?

904
01:13:28,261 --> 01:13:29,728
Sentiment?

905
01:13:30,764 --> 01:13:33,027
Eating away your brain like maggots!

906
01:13:37,337 --> 01:13:39,202
That's it.

907
01:13:39,406 --> 01:13:40,807
No!

908
01:13:40,907 --> 01:13:42,075
Sorry, boy.

909
01:13:42,175 --> 01:13:45,745
But a captain's gotta teach his men
what happens to those what cross him.

910
01:13:45,845 --> 01:13:47,573
Captain's gotta teach stuff!

911
01:13:49,949 --> 01:13:52,252
If you kill me now,

912
01:13:52,352 --> 01:13:56,879
you are saying goodbye to the
biggest score you have ever seen.

913
01:14:01,594 --> 01:14:03,493
The Stone?

914
01:14:03,797 --> 01:14:05,799
I hope you got something
better than that.

915
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:08,993
Because ain't nobody
stealing from Ronan.

916
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:11,104
We got a ringer.

917
01:14:11,204 --> 01:14:13,103
Is that right?

918
01:14:13,773 --> 01:14:16,209
She knows everything there
is to know about Ronan.

919
01:14:16,309 --> 01:14:17,610
His ships,

920
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:19,312
his army.

921
01:14:19,412 --> 01:14:21,709
He's vulnerable.

922
01:14:22,048 --> 01:14:23,350
Hey, what do you say, Yondu?

923
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:27,477
Me and you, taking down a mark
side-by-side, like the old days.

924
01:14:34,727 --> 01:14:36,251
Let him go!

925
01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:40,133
You always did have a scrote, boy!

926
01:14:40,233 --> 01:14:43,429
That's why I kept you on as a young'un.

927
01:14:51,244 --> 01:14:53,279
Captain, the shot was non-damaging.

928
01:14:53,379 --> 01:14:56,040
Attention, idiots.

929
01:14:57,684 --> 01:15:01,521
The lunatic on top of this craft
is holding a Hadron Enforcer.

930
01:15:01,621 --> 01:15:03,390
It's a weapon of my own design.

931
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:04,991
What the hell?

932
01:15:05,091 --> 01:15:07,861
If you don't hand over
our companions now,

933
01:15:07,961 --> 01:15:10,330
he's gonna tear your ship a new one.

934
01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:12,265
A very big new one!

935
01:15:12,365 --> 01:15:15,635
- I ain't buyin' it.
- I'm giving you to the count of five.

936
01:15:15,735 --> 01:15:18,905
- 5, 4, 3...
- No! Wait, hold on!

937
01:15:19,005 --> 01:15:20,840
Rocket, it's me, for God sakes!

938
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:23,009
We figured it out! We're fine!

939
01:15:23,109 --> 01:15:24,769
Hey, Quill. What's going on?

940
01:15:26,212 --> 01:15:27,847
You call that "figured it out"?

941
01:15:27,947 --> 01:15:30,316
We're gonna rob the guys
who just beat us senseless.

942
01:15:30,416 --> 01:15:31,851
You want to talk about senseless?

943
01:15:31,951 --> 01:15:34,220
How about trying to save
us by blowing us up?

944
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,157
We were only gonna blow you
up if they didn't turn you over!

945
01:15:37,257 --> 01:15:39,125
And how on earth were
they gonna turn us over

946
01:15:39,225 --> 01:15:40,760
when you only gave
them a count of five?

947
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:44,364
We didn't have time to work
out the minutiae of the plan.

948
01:15:44,464 --> 01:15:46,733
This is what we get for
acting altruistically.

949
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:49,002
- I am Groot.
- They are ungrateful.

950
01:15:49,102 --> 01:15:53,173
What's important now is we get the
Ravagers' army to help us save Xandar.

951
01:15:53,473 --> 01:15:57,043
So we can give the Stone to Yondu who's
just gonna sell to somebody even worse?

952
01:15:57,143 --> 01:16:00,213
- We'll figure that part out later.
- We have to stop Ronan.

953
01:16:00,313 --> 01:16:01,781
How?

954
01:16:01,881 --> 01:16:04,451
- I have a plan.
- You've got a plan?

955
01:16:04,551 --> 01:16:05,618
Yes.

956
01:16:05,719 --> 01:16:08,140
First of all, you're copying me
from when I said I had a plan.

957
01:16:08,241 --> 01:16:11,758
No, I'm not. People say that all the time.
It's not that unique of a thing to say.

958
01:16:11,858 --> 01:16:13,760
Secondly, I don't even
believe you have a plan.

959
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:16,663
I have part of a plan!

960
01:16:16,763 --> 01:16:18,298
What percentage of
a plan do you have?

961
01:16:18,398 --> 01:16:21,601
You don't get to ask questions after
the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere.

962
01:16:21,701 --> 01:16:23,336
I just saved Quill.

963
01:16:23,436 --> 01:16:26,172
We've already established that you destroying
the ship that I'm on is not saving me.

964
01:16:26,272 --> 01:16:28,508
- When did we establish it?
- Like three seconds ago!

965
01:16:28,608 --> 01:16:30,632
I wasn't listening. I was
thinking of something else.

966
01:16:31,277 --> 01:16:34,347
She's right. You don't get an opinion.
What percentage?

967
01:16:34,447 --> 01:16:37,679
- I don't know. Twelve percent.
- Twelve percent?

968
01:16:39,219 --> 01:16:40,420
That's a fake laugh.

969
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,255
- It's real!
- Totally fake.

970
01:16:42,355 --> 01:16:47,026
That is the most real, authentic,
hysterical laugh of my entire life

971
01:16:47,126 --> 01:16:49,562
- because that is not a plan.
- It's barely a concept.

972
01:16:49,662 --> 01:16:52,265
- You're taking their side?
- I am Groot.

973
01:16:52,365 --> 01:16:55,301
So what, it's better than 11%? What the
hell does that have to do with anything?

974
01:16:55,401 --> 01:16:58,037
Thank you, Groot. Thank you.

975
01:16:58,137 --> 01:17:02,038
See? Groot's the only one
of you who has a clue.

976
01:17:06,613 --> 01:17:08,102
Guys.

977
01:17:08,481 --> 01:17:09,616
Come on.

978
01:17:09,716 --> 01:17:11,718
Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds.

979
01:17:11,818 --> 01:17:14,786
He expects to hear this big plan of ours.

980
01:17:15,688 --> 01:17:18,053
I need your help.

981
01:17:19,325 --> 01:17:22,061
I look around at us.

982
01:17:22,161 --> 01:17:23,650
You know what I see?

983
01:17:24,163 --> 01:17:25,630
Losers.

984
01:17:27,834 --> 01:17:29,435
I mean, like,

985
01:17:29,535 --> 01:17:31,471
folks who have lost stuff.

986
01:17:31,571 --> 01:17:34,198
And we have. Man, we have. All of us.

987
01:17:34,874 --> 01:17:36,636
Our homes,

988
01:17:36,909 --> 01:17:38,740
our families,

989
01:17:39,412 --> 01:17:41,381
normal lives.

990
01:17:41,481 --> 01:17:44,677
And, usually, life takes more
than it gives. But not today.

991
01:17:45,051 --> 01:17:46,653
Today, it's given us something.

992
01:17:46,753 --> 01:17:48,354
It has given us a chance.

993
01:17:48,454 --> 01:17:50,251
To do what?

994
01:17:51,691 --> 01:17:53,453
To give a shit.

995
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:55,662
For once.

996
01:17:55,762 --> 01:17:58,230
Not run away.

997
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,102
I, for one, am not gonna
stand by and watch

998
01:18:03,202 --> 01:18:06,728
as Ronan wipes out
billions of innocent lives.

999
01:18:07,373 --> 01:18:10,433
But, Quill, stopping Ronan,

1000
01:18:11,077 --> 01:18:13,513
it's impossible.

1001
01:18:13,613 --> 01:18:16,377
You're asking us to die.

1002
01:18:22,588 --> 01:18:24,919
Yeah, I guess I am.

1003
01:18:37,303 --> 01:18:38,895
Quill.

1004
01:18:42,608 --> 01:18:46,407
I have lived most my life
surrounded by my enemies.

1005
01:18:49,982 --> 01:18:54,646
I will be grateful to
die among my friends.

1006
01:18:58,491 --> 01:19:00,891
You are an honorable man, Quill.

1007
01:19:02,128 --> 01:19:04,789
I will fight beside you.

1008
01:19:05,531 --> 01:19:07,498
And in the end,

1009
01:19:09,001 --> 01:19:11,492
I will see my wife and daughter again.

1010
01:19:17,009 --> 01:19:20,637
I am Groot.

1011
01:19:30,490 --> 01:19:34,187
What the hell. I don't got
that long a lifespan, anyway.

1012
01:19:39,732 --> 01:19:42,368
Now I'm standing. Y'all happy?

1013
01:19:42,468 --> 01:19:44,704
We're all standing up now.

1014
01:19:44,804 --> 01:19:48,501
Bunch of jackasses,
standing in a circle.

1015
01:19:55,281 --> 01:19:56,849
The Stone reacts to anything organic.

1016
01:19:56,949 --> 01:19:58,985
The bigger the target,
the bigger the power surge.

1017
01:19:59,085 --> 01:20:02,322
All Ronan's got to do is touch the
Stone to the planet's surface and zap.

1018
01:20:02,422 --> 01:20:04,123
All plants, animals,

1019
01:20:04,223 --> 01:20:06,156
- Nova Corps.
- Everything will die.

1020
01:20:06,359 --> 01:20:08,759
So Ronan does not make the surface.

1021
01:20:11,264 --> 01:20:13,299
Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole

1022
01:20:13,399 --> 01:20:15,601
in the Dark Aster's starboard hull.

1023
01:20:15,701 --> 01:20:19,772
Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.

1024
01:20:19,872 --> 01:20:22,642
Won't there be hundreds of
Sakaaran soldiers inside?

1025
01:20:22,742 --> 01:20:26,040
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.

1026
01:20:31,417 --> 01:20:32,852
Once they know we're on board,

1027
01:20:32,952 --> 01:20:36,356
Ronan will isolate himself behind
impenetrable security doors on deck.

1028
01:20:36,456 --> 01:20:38,958
Which I can disable by
dismantling the power source.

1029
01:20:39,058 --> 01:20:40,760
We'll make it to the flight deck,

1030
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:44,329
and I'll use the Hadron
Enforcer to kill Ronan.

1031
01:20:46,432 --> 01:20:49,902
Once Ronan is dead,
we will retrieve the Stone.

1032
01:20:50,002 --> 01:20:52,438
Use these devices to contain it.

1033
01:20:52,538 --> 01:20:54,335
If you touch it,

1034
01:20:54,607 --> 01:20:56,404
it will kill you.

1035
01:20:58,778 --> 01:21:02,014
I'll contact one of the Nova
officers who arrested us.

1036
01:21:02,114 --> 01:21:05,208
Hopefully, they'll believe
we're there to help.

1037
01:21:05,318 --> 01:21:08,946
There's one more thing we
need to complete the plan.

1038
01:21:09,255 --> 01:21:10,915
That guy's eye.

1039
01:21:11,390 --> 01:21:13,960
No! No, we don't. No, we don't need

1040
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:15,857
that guy's eye.

1041
01:21:16,496 --> 01:21:19,556
No, seriously, I need it!
It's important to me.

1042
01:21:23,769 --> 01:21:26,706
Ronan's fleet has been spotted,
and will arrive in T-minus

1043
01:21:26,806 --> 01:21:28,708
fifteen minutes.

1044
01:21:28,808 --> 01:21:30,643
Remember, boy.

1045
01:21:30,743 --> 01:21:32,678
At the end of all this,

1046
01:21:32,778 --> 01:21:34,113
I get the Stone.

1047
01:21:34,213 --> 01:21:37,113
You cross me, we kill you all.

1048
01:21:59,305 --> 01:22:01,102
Let's go get 'em, boys!

1049
01:22:10,149 --> 01:22:11,451
This is a terrible plan.

1050
01:22:11,551 --> 01:22:14,110
Hey, you're the one who said
you wanted to die among friends.

1051
01:22:18,591 --> 01:22:20,058
Nova Prime.

1052
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:22,562
I received a transmission

1053
01:22:22,662 --> 01:22:24,356
from one of the Ravagers.

1054
01:22:24,463 --> 01:22:27,099
He says Ronan's in possession of
something called an Infinity Stone

1055
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:28,568
and he's headed toward Xandar.

1056
01:22:28,668 --> 01:22:29,936
Good God.

1057
01:22:30,036 --> 01:22:32,004
It's a trick. He's a criminal.

1058
01:22:32,104 --> 01:22:34,574
Did he say why we should believe him?

1059
01:22:34,674 --> 01:22:36,909
He said his crew just
escaped from prison

1060
01:22:37,009 --> 01:22:40,444
so he'd have no other reason to
risk coming to Xandar to help.

1061
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:42,406
He says that he's an

1062
01:22:43,015 --> 01:22:44,317
"a-hole."

1063
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:45,685
But he's not,

1064
01:22:45,785 --> 01:22:47,520
and I'm quoting him, here,

1065
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:49,922
"100% a dick."

1066
01:22:50,022 --> 01:22:51,784
Do you believe him?

1067
01:22:51,991 --> 01:22:55,027
I don't know that I believe
anyone is 100% a dick, ma'am.

1068
01:22:55,127 --> 01:22:58,528
I mean, do you believe
that he is here to help?

1069
01:23:01,767 --> 01:23:03,234
Yeah.

1070
01:23:12,878 --> 01:23:14,680
A fleet approaches.

1071
01:23:14,780 --> 01:23:16,838
They appear to be Ravagers.

1072
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:29,018
Fire!

1073
01:23:39,905 --> 01:23:41,140
Cover it down.

1074
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:43,605
Submerge!

1075
01:23:56,088 --> 01:23:57,748
Rocket, hurry!

1076
01:24:03,796 --> 01:24:05,064
All pilots, dive!

1077
01:24:05,164 --> 01:24:06,790
They're beneath us!

1078
01:24:15,174 --> 01:24:16,642
Evacuate the city.

1079
01:24:16,742 --> 01:24:20,700
Our priority is to get our
people away from the battle.

1080
01:24:27,219 --> 01:24:28,708
Forward thrust, now!

1081
01:24:41,801 --> 01:24:43,268
Come on!

1082
01:24:44,503 --> 01:24:46,527
Quill! Yondu! Now!

1083
01:25:08,394 --> 01:25:09,962
Hell!

1084
01:25:10,062 --> 01:25:11,564
I'm going down, Quill!

1085
01:25:11,664 --> 01:25:13,466
No more games with me, boy!

1086
01:25:13,566 --> 01:25:14,667
I'll see you

1087
01:25:14,767 --> 01:25:16,962
at the end of this!

1088
01:25:22,808 --> 01:25:24,673
There are too many of them, Rocket!

1089
01:25:24,977 --> 01:25:27,172
We'll never make it up there!

1090
01:25:41,727 --> 01:25:42,928
Peter Quill.

1091
01:25:43,028 --> 01:25:45,464
This is Denarian Saal
of the Nova Corps.

1092
01:25:45,564 --> 01:25:48,934
For the record, I advised
against trusting you here.

1093
01:25:49,034 --> 01:25:50,736
They got my "dick" message!

1094
01:25:50,836 --> 01:25:52,462
Prove me wrong.

1095
01:25:59,445 --> 01:26:01,776
Yes!

1096
01:26:22,501 --> 01:26:24,059
Yes!

1097
01:26:27,039 --> 01:26:29,166
We're just like Kevin Bacon.

1098
01:26:32,945 --> 01:26:34,513
The starboard kern has been breached!

1099
01:26:34,613 --> 01:26:35,915
We have been boarded.

1100
01:26:36,015 --> 01:26:37,483
Continue our approach.

1101
01:26:37,583 --> 01:26:38,918
But the Nova Corps have engaged.

1102
01:26:39,018 --> 01:26:41,687
None of that will matter
once we reach the surface.

1103
01:26:41,787 --> 01:26:42,888
Seal security doors!

1104
01:26:42,988 --> 01:26:44,477
Now!

1105
01:26:45,791 --> 01:26:48,521
Get out of my way!

1106
01:26:59,305 --> 01:27:00,873
Oh, man.

1107
01:27:00,973 --> 01:27:05,411
All Nova pilots,
interlock and form a blockade.

1108
01:27:05,511 --> 01:27:09,811
The Dark Aster must
not reach the ground.

1109
01:27:21,894 --> 01:27:23,520
Locked in!

1110
01:27:23,929 --> 01:27:25,521
Locked in.

1111
01:27:26,665 --> 01:27:28,132
We're locked in.

1112
01:28:05,971 --> 01:28:08,564
I can barely see.

1113
01:28:34,466 --> 01:28:36,669
When did you learn to do that?

1114
01:28:36,769 --> 01:28:37,937
Pretty sure the answer is

1115
01:28:38,037 --> 01:28:40,061
"I am Groot."

1116
01:28:40,773 --> 01:28:43,741
The flight deck is 300 meters this way.

1117
01:28:46,545 --> 01:28:50,349
I want you all to know that I am grateful
for your acceptance after my blunders.

1118
01:28:50,449 --> 01:28:53,144
It is pleasing to once again have

1119
01:28:53,285 --> 01:28:54,752
friends.

1120
01:28:55,387 --> 01:28:58,257
You, Quill, are my friend.

1121
01:28:58,357 --> 01:28:59,625
Thanks.

1122
01:28:59,725 --> 01:29:02,284
This dumb tree, he is my friend.

1123
01:29:03,963 --> 01:29:07,264
- And this green whore, she, too...
- You must stop!

1124
01:29:09,702 --> 01:29:15,307
Gamora, look at what you have done.
You have always been weak.

1125
01:29:15,407 --> 01:29:17,966
You stupid, traitorous...

1126
01:29:22,715 --> 01:29:25,479
Nobody talks to my friends like that.

1127
01:29:26,151 --> 01:29:30,479
Head to the flight deck. I'll shut
down the power to the security doors.

1128
01:29:38,030 --> 01:29:39,899
Yondu Udonta.

1129
01:29:39,999 --> 01:29:43,957
Order your men to turn
on the Nova Corps.

1130
01:30:00,285 --> 01:30:01,887
Enough nonsense, Ravager!

1131
01:30:01,987 --> 01:30:04,250
Time to die...

1132
01:30:36,488 --> 01:30:37,977
Nebula, please.

1133
01:30:52,037 --> 01:30:54,840
Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots,

1134
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:57,465
enact immolation initiative.

1135
01:31:00,546 --> 01:31:02,047
They're dive-bombing the city!

1136
01:31:02,147 --> 01:31:03,983
Denarian Saal,
should we break formation?

1137
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:06,175
No! Hold your positions.

1138
01:31:37,382 --> 01:31:38,851
Keep Ronan up there, Saal.

1139
01:31:38,951 --> 01:31:40,586
We'll take care of the
people down here.

1140
01:31:40,686 --> 01:31:43,313
I can't believe I'm taking
orders from a hamster.

1141
01:31:46,058 --> 01:31:47,659
Star-Lord.

1142
01:31:47,759 --> 01:31:49,226
Finally.

1143
01:31:59,671 --> 01:32:01,195
You thief!

1144
01:32:12,618 --> 01:32:15,916
You will never make it to Ronan.

1145
01:32:21,193 --> 01:32:23,923
Everybody shoot them
before they hit the ground.

1146
01:32:32,104 --> 01:32:33,935
Come on!

1147
01:33:16,315 --> 01:33:20,251
Finger to the throat means death.

1148
01:33:25,624 --> 01:33:27,092
Metaphor.

1149
01:33:27,192 --> 01:33:28,527
Yeah, sorta.

1150
01:33:28,627 --> 01:33:30,253
No.

1151
01:33:57,756 --> 01:33:59,655
Xandar!

1152
01:33:59,858 --> 01:34:02,918
You stand accused.

1153
01:34:03,295 --> 01:34:06,365
Your wretched peace treaty will not

1154
01:34:06,465 --> 01:34:08,066
save you now.

1155
01:34:08,166 --> 01:34:11,863
It is the tinder on which you burn.

1156
01:34:36,028 --> 01:34:37,095
Rocket!

1157
01:34:37,195 --> 01:34:39,424
Hold on, Saal, just...

1158
01:35:05,724 --> 01:35:06,992
Quill, you gotta hurry.

1159
01:35:07,092 --> 01:35:08,727
The city's been evacuated,

1160
01:35:08,827 --> 01:35:11,396
but we're getting our
asses kicked down here.

1161
01:35:11,496 --> 01:35:13,395
Gamora hasn't opened the door!

1162
01:35:37,656 --> 01:35:39,123
Nebula!

1163
01:35:40,225 --> 01:35:42,828
Sister, help us fight Ronan.

1164
01:35:42,928 --> 01:35:44,763
You know he's crazy.

1165
01:35:44,863 --> 01:35:46,965
I know you're both crazy.

1166
01:35:47,065 --> 01:35:48,691
No!

1167
01:35:51,136 --> 01:35:52,603
What the?

1168
01:35:53,405 --> 01:35:55,395
Get out!

1169
01:36:36,348 --> 01:36:37,815
You did it!

1170
01:37:03,875 --> 01:37:05,143
I was mistaken.

1171
01:37:05,243 --> 01:37:07,301
I do remember your family.

1172
01:37:07,479 --> 01:37:09,281
Their screams were

1173
01:37:09,381 --> 01:37:11,940
pitiful. I...

1174
01:39:08,633 --> 01:39:10,191
No, Groot!

1175
01:39:10,335 --> 01:39:11,436
You can't.

1176
01:39:11,536 --> 01:39:13,469
You'll die.

1177
01:39:13,572 --> 01:39:15,474
Why are you doing this?

1178
01:39:15,574 --> 01:39:17,507
Why?

1179
01:39:23,682 --> 01:39:25,550
We

1180
01:39:25,650 --> 01:39:27,139
are

1181
01:39:27,319 --> 01:39:29,252
Groot.

1182
01:40:33,218 --> 01:40:35,709
I called him an idiot.

1183
01:40:57,976 --> 01:41:00,376
You killed Groot!

1184
01:41:04,082 --> 01:41:05,810
Behold!

1185
01:41:06,284 --> 01:41:09,721
Your guardians of the galaxy.

1186
01:41:09,821 --> 01:41:12,257
What fruit have they wrought?

1187
01:41:12,357 --> 01:41:16,461
Only that my father and his father

1188
01:41:16,561 --> 01:41:20,198
shall finally know vengeance.

1189
01:41:20,298 --> 01:41:22,993
People of Xandar,

1190
01:41:23,168 --> 01:41:24,970
the time has come

1191
01:41:25,070 --> 01:41:27,939
to rejoice and renounce

1192
01:41:28,039 --> 01:41:30,734
your paltry gods!

1193
01:41:31,109 --> 01:41:34,908
Your salvation is at hand.

1194
01:41:47,192 --> 01:41:49,159
Listen to these words.

1195
01:41:57,769 --> 01:41:59,896
Now bring it down hard!

1196
01:42:02,874 --> 01:42:04,342
What are you doing?

1197
01:42:04,442 --> 01:42:07,467
Dance-off, bro. Me and you.

1198
01:42:10,448 --> 01:42:12,313
Gamora.

1199
01:42:12,884 --> 01:42:15,286
Subtle. Take it back.

1200
01:42:15,386 --> 01:42:17,822
What are you doing?

1201
01:42:17,922 --> 01:42:20,720
I'm distracting you,
you big turd blossom.

1202
01:42:36,474 --> 01:42:38,464
No!

1203
01:43:11,976 --> 01:43:15,570
Peter! Take my hand!

1204
01:43:20,518 --> 01:43:22,986
Take my hand, Peter.

1205
01:43:23,454 --> 01:43:25,256
Mom.

1206
01:43:25,356 --> 01:43:27,881
Take my hand!

1207
01:44:21,846 --> 01:44:23,882
You're mortal!

1208
01:44:23,982 --> 01:44:25,316
How?

1209
01:44:25,416 --> 01:44:27,619
You said it yourself, bitch.

1210
01:44:27,719 --> 01:44:30,551
We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1211
01:44:59,951 --> 01:45:01,619
Well, well, well.

1212
01:45:01,719 --> 01:45:03,243
Quite the light show.

1213
01:45:05,089 --> 01:45:07,216
Ain't this sweet.

1214
01:45:08,326 --> 01:45:10,862
But you got some business to attend to

1215
01:45:10,962 --> 01:45:13,862
before all the nookie-nookie starts.

1216
01:45:15,099 --> 01:45:17,335
Peter, you can't. Peter.

1217
01:45:17,435 --> 01:45:21,539
You gotta reconsider this, Yondu.
I don't know who you're selling this to,

1218
01:45:21,639 --> 01:45:25,868
but the only way the universe can survive
is if you give it to the Nova Corps.

1219
01:45:26,244 --> 01:45:28,871
I may be as pretty as an angel,

1220
01:45:30,682 --> 01:45:33,013
but I sure as hell ain't one.

1221
01:45:34,252 --> 01:45:36,219
Hand it over, son.

1222
01:45:52,603 --> 01:45:54,070
Yondu.

1223
01:45:56,708 --> 01:46:00,439
Do not open that Orb.
You know that, right?

1224
01:46:00,611 --> 01:46:03,545
You've seen what it does to people.

1225
01:46:13,825 --> 01:46:16,520
Yeah, Quill turned out okay.

1226
01:46:16,928 --> 01:46:19,564
It's probably good we didn't
deliver him to his dad

1227
01:46:19,664 --> 01:46:20,665
like we was hired to do.

1228
01:46:20,765 --> 01:46:23,961
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.

1229
01:46:28,373 --> 01:46:32,400
He is gonna be so pissed when he
realizes I switched out the Orb on him.

1230
01:46:34,679 --> 01:46:36,976
He was gonna kill you, Peter.

1231
01:46:37,749 --> 01:46:39,876
I know.

1232
01:46:41,285 --> 01:46:43,377
But he was about the only family I had.

1233
01:46:45,823 --> 01:46:47,312
No.

1234
01:46:48,126 --> 01:46:49,786
He wasn't.

1235
01:47:37,575 --> 01:47:39,143
Why would you even know this?

1236
01:47:39,243 --> 01:47:41,980
When we arrested you, we noticed
an anomaly in your nervous system,

1237
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:43,945
so we had it checked out.

1238
01:47:44,782 --> 01:47:46,484
I'm not Terran?

1239
01:47:46,584 --> 01:47:48,152
You are half Terran.

1240
01:47:48,252 --> 01:47:51,956
Your mother was of Earth.
Your father, well,

1241
01:47:52,056 --> 01:47:55,827
he's something very ancient
we've never seen here before.

1242
01:47:55,927 --> 01:47:59,956
That could be why you were able to
hold the Stone for as long as you did.

1243
01:48:00,398 --> 01:48:01,865
Your friends have arrived.

1244
01:48:03,301 --> 01:48:05,870
On behalf of the Nova Corps,

1245
01:48:05,970 --> 01:48:11,568
we'd like to express our profound
gratitude for your help in saving Xandar.

1246
01:48:12,944 --> 01:48:15,713
If you will follow Denarian Dey,

1247
01:48:15,813 --> 01:48:19,577
- he has something to show you.
- Thank you, Nova Prime.

1248
01:48:27,925 --> 01:48:32,830
Your wife and child shall rest well
knowing that you have avenged them.

1249
01:48:32,930 --> 01:48:34,165
Yes.

1250
01:48:34,265 --> 01:48:36,630
Of course, Ronan was only a puppet.

1251
01:48:36,934 --> 01:48:39,561
It's really Thanos I need to kill.

1252
01:48:41,772 --> 01:48:45,002
We tried to keep it as close
to the original as possible.

1253
01:48:45,143 --> 01:48:47,577
We salvaged as much as we could.

1254
01:48:50,214 --> 01:48:51,681
I...

1255
01:48:53,217 --> 01:48:54,775
Thank you.

1256
01:48:55,887 --> 01:48:57,955
I have a family.

1257
01:48:58,055 --> 01:48:59,988
They're alive because of you.

1258
01:49:04,228 --> 01:49:06,664
Your criminal records
have also been expunged.

1259
01:49:06,764 --> 01:49:11,166
However, I have to warn you against
breaking any laws in the future.

1260
01:49:11,335 --> 01:49:13,638
Question. What if I see
something that I want to take,

1261
01:49:13,738 --> 01:49:16,407
- and it belongs to someone else?
- You will be arrested.

1262
01:49:16,507 --> 01:49:19,110
But what if I want it more
than the person who has it?

1263
01:49:19,210 --> 01:49:21,012
- It's still illegal.
- That doesn't follow.

1264
01:49:21,112 --> 01:49:23,848
No, I want it more, sir. Do you
understand? What are you laughing at?

1265
01:49:23,948 --> 01:49:25,783
Why? I can't have a discussion
with this gentleman?

1266
01:49:25,883 --> 01:49:27,785
What if someone does
something irksome

1267
01:49:27,885 --> 01:49:30,546
and I decide to remove his spine?

1268
01:49:31,656 --> 01:49:33,214
That's...

1269
01:49:33,858 --> 01:49:36,519
That's actually murder.

1270
01:49:37,862 --> 01:49:40,465
It's one of the worst crimes of all.

1271
01:49:40,565 --> 01:49:43,863
So... also illegal.

1272
01:49:47,004 --> 01:49:48,493
They'll be fine, Dey.

1273
01:49:48,739 --> 01:49:49,974
I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.

1274
01:49:50,074 --> 01:49:51,541
You?

1275
01:49:54,545 --> 01:49:57,980
Yeah. Me.

1276
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:18,490
Peter,

1277
01:50:18,603 --> 01:50:22,402
I know these last few months
have been hard for you.

1278
01:50:23,241 --> 01:50:25,910
But I'm going to a better place.

1279
01:50:26,010 --> 01:50:28,513
And I will be okay.

1280
01:50:28,613 --> 01:50:32,810
And I will always be with you.

1281
01:50:34,051 --> 01:50:36,787
You are the light of my life.

1282
01:50:36,887 --> 01:50:39,582
My precious son.

1283
01:50:40,091 --> 01:50:43,492
My little Star-Lord.

1284
01:50:43,761 --> 01:50:46,195
Love, Mom.

1285
01:52:46,317 --> 01:52:48,185
So, what should we do next?

1286
01:52:48,285 --> 01:52:49,752
Something good?

1287
01:52:50,321 --> 01:52:51,822
Something bad?

1288
01:52:51,922 --> 01:52:54,014
A bit of both?

1289
01:52:55,192 --> 01:52:58,559
We'll follow your lead, Star-Lord.

1290
01:53:00,364 --> 01:53:01,853
Bit of both.

1291
02:00:25,742 --> 02:00:28,506
What do you let it lick you like that for?

1292
02:00:29,379 --> 02:00:31,403
Gross.

1293
02:00:33,984 --> 02:00:35,551
Yeah!

1294
02:00:35,552 --> 02:00:37,849
But it burns going down.
