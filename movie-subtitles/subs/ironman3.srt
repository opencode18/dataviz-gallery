How so?

Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

1722
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,890
I know I'm shorter in person.
A bit smaller. Everyone says that.

1723
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:42,849
But, um, hey,
if you're here to arrest me,

1724
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,724
there's some people I'd like to roll on.

1725
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,245
Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.

1726
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,482
You tell him where Pepper is
and he'll stop doing it.

1727
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,085
- Doing what?
(SIZZLING)

1728
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:52,367
Oh! I get it! Ow! That hurt.
I get it! I get it!

1729
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:56,168
I don't know about any Pepper,
but I know about the plan.

1733
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:02,088
But I do know it's happening
off the coast.

1734
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:05,562
Something to do with a big boat.

1735
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:07,005
I can take you there.

I'm gonna blow his face off.

01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:16,685
Oh, and this next bit may include
the vice president as well.

1739
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:18,441
Is that...
Is that important?

1740
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,284
- Somewhat.
- Yeah, a little bit.

1741

TONY: So?

1742
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,045
RHODEY: What are we gonna do?

1743
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:27,201
I mean, we don't have any transport.

1744
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,281
- Right.
(BEER OPENS)

Hey, Ringo.

1746
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:34,006
Didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?

1747
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:38,720
If he's right about the location,
we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.

1748
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:39,927
But we also have to figure out this

1749
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,764
- vice president thing, right?
- Right.

1750
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,080
I wonder who I'm calling right now.

1751
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:44,360
Oh! That's the vice president.

1752
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,686
Thanks.

TONY: <i>Sir, this is Tony Stark.</i>

Welcome back to the land of the living.

1756

We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign.

1757
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,125
We gotta get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.

1758
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,921
Mr Stark, I'm about
to eat honey-roast ham,

1759
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,241
surrounded by the Agency's finest.

1760
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:03,642
The president's safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.

1761
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:04,767
I think we're good, here.

1762
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,842
RHODEY: <i>Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.</i>

1763
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,120
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.

1764
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:10,565
<i>They're gonna take out
the president somehow.</i>

1765
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,401
We have to immediately
alert that plane.

1766
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,608
Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.

1767
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:17,604
If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.

1768
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,520
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Rhodes and Stark out.

Couldn't be better.

I love you, babe.

1772
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:55,365
Colonel Rhodes.

1773
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:58,762
Glad to see you could make it, son.
I feel safer already.

1774
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:04,726
RHODEY:
We gotta make a decision.

1775
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,610
We can either save the president,
or Pepper. We can't do both.
