1
00:00:23,343 --> 00:00:25,678
Been a while since I was
up here in front of you.

2
00:00:25,762 --> 00:00:28,847
Maybe I'll do us all a favour
and just stick to the cards.

3
00:00:31,935 --> 00:00:34,603
There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred

4
00:00:34,688 --> 00:00:36,105
on the freeway and
the rooftop...

5
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:39,233
Sorry, Mr. Stark, do you honestly
expect us to believe that

6
00:00:39,317 --> 00:00:42,903
that was a bodyguard in a suit
that conveniently appeared,

7
00:00:42,987 --> 00:00:45,698
despite the fact that you
sorely despise bodyguards?

8
00:00:45,782 --> 00:00:46,907
Yes.

9
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:51,662
And this mysterious bodyguard
was somehow equipped

10
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:55,165
with an undisclosed Stark
high-tech powered battle...

11
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,209
I know that it's confusing.

12
00:00:57,293 --> 00:01:00,838
It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely

13
00:01:00,922 --> 00:01:04,133
to make wild accusations, or
insinuate that I'm a superhero.

14
00:01:07,137 --> 00:01:10,431
I mean, let's face it,
I'm not the heroic type.

15
00:01:10,515 --> 00:01:12,725
A laundry list of
character defects,

16
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:15,644
all the mistakes I've
made, largely public.

17
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:17,354
The truth is

18
00:01:22,318 --> 00:01:24,278
I am Iron Man.

19
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:36,248
Ivan.

20
00:01:41,504 --> 00:01:42,004
Vanya.

21
00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:22,224
270 at 30 knots. Holding
steady at 15,000 feet.

22
00:05:22,308 --> 00:05:30,308
You are clear for exfiltration
over the drop zone.

23
00:07:19,967 --> 00:07:24,137
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

24
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,556
It's good to be back.

25
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:30,227
- You missed me?
- Blow something up!

26
00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:34,481
I missed you, too. Blow something up?
I already did that.

27
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:37,817
I'm not saying that
the world is enjoying

28
00:07:37,902 --> 00:07:42,072
its longest period of uninterrupted
peace in years because of me.

29
00:07:45,034 --> 00:07:50,789
I'm not saying that from
the ashes of captivity,

30
00:07:51,415 --> 00:07:55,919
never has a greater Phoenix metaphor
been personified in human history.

31
00:07:59,006 --> 00:08:04,928
I'm not saying that Uncle Sam
can kick back on a lawn chair,

32
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:06,638
sipping on an iced tea

33
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:09,766
because I haven't come across
anyone who's man enough

34
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,727
to go toe-to-toe with
me on my best day.

35
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:18,358
I love you, Tony!

36
00:08:18,442 --> 00:08:20,569
Please, it's not about me.

37
00:08:21,946 --> 00:08:23,738
It's not about you.

38
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:28,994
It's not even about us.
It's about legacy.

39
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:32,831
It's about what we choose to leave
behind for future generations.

40
00:08:32,915 --> 00:08:37,043
And that's why for the next year
and for the first time since 1974,

41
00:08:37,128 --> 00:08:39,546
the best and brightest
men and women

42
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,590
of nations and corporations
the world over

43
00:08:41,674 --> 00:08:45,176
will pool their resources,
share their collective vision,

44
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:48,305
to leave behind a
brighter future.

45
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:50,140
It's not about us.

46
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:54,185
Therefore, what I'm saying,
if I'm saying anything,

47
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,813
is welcome back to
the Stark Expo.

48
00:09:00,568 --> 00:09:03,236
And now, making a special
guest appearance

49
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:05,739
from the great beyond to tell
you what it's all about,

50
00:09:05,823 --> 00:09:08,325
please welcome my
father, Howard.

51
00:09:10,661 --> 00:09:13,622
Everything is achievable
through technology.

52
00:09:13,706 --> 00:09:15,999
Better living, robust health,

53
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,046
and for the first time in human history,
the possibility of world peace.

54
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,048
So, from all of us here
at Stark industries,

55
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:27,927
I would like to personally introduce
you to the City of the Future.

56
00:09:28,012 --> 00:09:31,765
Technology holds infinite
possibilities for mankind,

57
00:09:31,849 --> 00:09:34,684
and will one day rid
society of all its ills.

58
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:38,355
Soon, technology will affect the
way you live your life every day.

59
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:40,023
No more tedious work,

60
00:09:40,316 --> 00:09:44,736
leaving more time for leisure
activities and enjoying the sweet life.

61
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,572
The Stark Expo. Welcome.

62
00:09:52,745 --> 00:09:55,664
We are coming to you live from
the kickoff of the Stark Expo,

63
00:09:55,748 --> 00:09:58,625
where Tony Stark has
just walked offstage.

64
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:00,293
Don't worry if you can't
make it down here tonight

65
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:02,796
because this Expo goes
on all year long.

66
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,881
And I'm gonna be here checking
out all the attractions

67
00:10:04,965 --> 00:10:08,510
and the pavilions and the inventions
from all around the world.

68
00:10:08,594 --> 00:10:09,812
Make sure you join me...

69
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:11,054
All right, it's a zoo
out there, watch out.

70
00:10:11,138 --> 00:10:13,973
- Open up, let's go.
- Hey! Nice to see you.

71
00:10:14,058 --> 00:10:16,601
- All right. Thank you. I remember you.
- Tony, Tony...

72
00:10:16,686 --> 00:10:18,228
Hey, hey...

73
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:20,772
- Call me.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.

74
00:10:20,856 --> 00:10:23,316
Hello. It would be a pleasure.

75
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:24,901
- Okay.
- See you, buddy.

76
00:10:24,985 --> 00:10:26,069
This is Larry.

77
00:10:26,153 --> 00:10:28,238
Hey, the oracle of Oracle.
What a pleasure.

78
00:10:28,322 --> 00:10:29,823
- Nice to see you.
- Call me. Call me.

79
00:10:29,907 --> 00:10:31,700
- Larry King.
- Larry!

80
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,536
Yes, my people, my people.

81
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,162
Come on, Tony. There we go.

82
00:10:36,247 --> 00:10:38,123
- Very mellow.
- That wasn't so bad.

83
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,499
No, it was perfect.

84
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,084
Look what we got
here, the new model.

85
00:10:41,168 --> 00:10:42,877
- Hey, does she come with the car?
- I certainly hope so.

86
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:44,045
- Hi.
- Hi.

87
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,296
- And you are?
- Marshal.

88
00:10:45,381 --> 00:10:47,298
- Irish. I like it.
- Pleased to meet you, Tony.

89
00:10:47,383 --> 00:10:49,551
I'm on the wheel. Do you mind?
Where you from?

90
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:50,885
- Bedford.
- What are you doing here?

91
00:10:51,011 --> 00:10:53,722
- Looking for you.
- Yeah? You found me.

92
00:10:55,182 --> 00:10:58,268
- What are you up to later?
- Serving subpoenas.

93
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,896
He doesn't like to
be handed things.

94
00:11:02,022 --> 00:11:03,565
- Yeah, I have a peeve.
- I got it.

95
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:04,774
You are hereby ordered

96
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,110
to appear before the Senate
Armed Services Committee

97
00:11:07,236 --> 00:11:08,862
tomorrow morning at 9: 00 A.M.

98
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:10,530
- Can I see a badge?
- You wanna see the badge?

99
00:11:10,614 --> 00:11:12,907
He likes the badge.

100
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:15,076
- You still like it?
- Yep.

101
00:11:17,121 --> 00:11:20,582
- How far are we from D.C.?
- D.C.? 250 miles.

102
00:11:23,335 --> 00:11:29,215
Mr. Stark, could we pick up now where
we left off? Mr. Stark. Please.

103
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,901
- Yes, dear?
- Can I have your attention?

104
00:11:30,968 --> 00:11:32,051
Absolutely.

105
00:11:32,136 --> 00:11:35,096
Do you or do you not possess
a specialised weapon?

106
00:11:35,222 --> 00:11:37,474
- I do not. I do not.
- You do not?

107
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,059
Well, it depends on how you
define the word "weapon."

108
00:11:40,144 --> 00:11:42,812
- The Iron Man weapon.
- My device does not fit that description.

109
00:11:42,938 --> 00:11:44,606
Well... How would
you describe it?

110
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:47,734
I would describe it by defining
it as what it is, Senator.

111
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:51,613
- As?
- It's a high-tech prosthesis.

112
00:11:51,739 --> 00:11:52,739
That is... That is...

113
00:11:52,823 --> 00:11:55,116
That's actually the most apt
description I can make of it.

114
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:57,076
It's a weapon. It's a
weapon, Mr. Stark.

115
00:11:57,161 --> 00:12:00,330
Please, if your priority was actually the
well-being of the American citizen...

116
00:12:00,331 --> 00:12:03,208
My priority is to get the Iron Man
weapon turned over to the people

117
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:06,669
- of the United States of America.
- Well, you can forget it.

118
00:12:07,254 --> 00:12:11,007
I am Iron Man. The
suit and I are one.

119
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:13,551
To turn over the Iron Man suit
would be to turn over myself,

120
00:12:13,636 --> 00:12:16,638
which is tantamount to indentured
servitude or prostitution,

121
00:12:16,764 --> 00:12:18,389
depending on what
state you're in.

122
00:12:18,474 --> 00:12:21,434
- You can't have it.
- Look, I'm no expert...

123
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,313
In prostitution? Of course not.
You're a senator. Come on.

124
00:12:26,273 --> 00:12:28,733
I'm no expert in weapons.

125
00:12:28,818 --> 00:12:30,652
We have somebody here who
is an expert on weapons.

126
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:35,490
I'd now like to call Justin Hammer, our
current primary weapons contractor.

127
00:12:36,492 --> 00:12:39,994
Let the record reflect that I observed
Mr. Hammer entering the chamber,

128
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,412
and I am wondering

129
00:12:41,497 --> 00:12:45,291
if and when any actual expert
will also be in attendance.

130
00:12:49,171 --> 00:12:53,508
Absolutely. I'm no expert.
I defer to you, Anthony.

131
00:12:53,634 --> 00:12:55,593
You're the wonder boy.

132
00:12:55,678 --> 00:12:57,804
Senator, if I may.

133
00:12:57,888 --> 00:13:02,350
I may well not be an expert, but
you know who was the expert?

134
00:13:02,476 --> 00:13:05,061
Your dad. Howard Stark.

135
00:13:05,187 --> 00:13:09,566
Really a father to us all, and
to the military-industrial age.

136
00:13:10,192 --> 00:13:12,432
Let's just be clear. He
was no flower child.

137
00:13:12,445 --> 00:13:14,696
He was a lion.

138
00:13:14,822 --> 00:13:17,198
We all know why we're here.
In the last six months,

139
00:13:17,324 --> 00:13:21,411
Anthony Stark has created a sword
with untold possibilities.

140
00:13:21,537 --> 00:13:24,330
And yet he insists
it's a shield.

141
00:13:24,415 --> 00:13:29,043
He asks us to trust him
as we cower behind it.

142
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:32,380
I wish I were comforted,
Anthony, I really do.

143
00:13:32,506 --> 00:13:35,592
I'd love to leave my door
unlocked when I leave the house,

144
00:13:35,718 --> 00:13:37,135
but this ain't Canada.

145
00:13:37,219 --> 00:13:38,887
You know, we live in a
world of grave threats,

146
00:13:39,013 --> 00:13:42,724
threats that Mr. Stark will not
always be able to foresee.

147
00:13:43,851 --> 00:13:45,226
Thank you.

148
00:13:45,352 --> 00:13:48,062
God bless Iron Man.
God bless America.

149
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:51,274
That is well said, Mr. Hammer.

150
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,318
The committee would
now like to invite.

151
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:56,529
Lieutenant Colonel James
Rhodes to the chamber.

152
00:13:56,614 --> 00:13:58,114
Rhodey? What?

153
00:14:04,455 --> 00:14:07,707
Hey, buddy. I didn't
expect to see you here.

154
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,418
Look, it's me, I'm here. Deal with it.
Let's move on.

155
00:14:10,544 --> 00:14:11,586
I just...

156
00:14:11,712 --> 00:14:13,152
- Drop it.
- All right, I'll drop it.

157
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:16,674
I have before me a complete
report on the Iron Man weapon,

158
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,427
compiled by Colonel Rhodes.
And, Colonel, for the record,

159
00:14:19,553 --> 00:14:22,639
can you please read page
57, paragraph four?

160
00:14:22,765 --> 00:14:25,016
You're requesting that I
read specific selections

161
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,392
- from my report, Senator?
- Yes, sir.

162
00:14:26,477 --> 00:14:28,394
It was my understanding that
I was going to be testifying

163
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:30,647
in a much more comprehensive
and detailed manner.

164
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:32,357
I understand. A lot of
things have changed today.

165
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:33,733
- So if you could just read...
- You do understand

166
00:14:33,817 --> 00:14:36,319
that reading a single paragraph
out of context does not reflect

167
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,614
- the summary of my final...
- Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.

168
00:14:40,658 --> 00:14:42,075
Very well.

169
00:14:43,994 --> 00:14:47,288
"As he does not operate within any
definable branch of government,."

170
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:53,378
"Iron Man presents a potential threat
to the security of both the nation"

171
00:14:53,462 --> 00:14:54,879
"and to her interests."

172
00:14:54,964 --> 00:14:56,839
I did, however, go
on to summarise

173
00:14:56,966 --> 00:14:59,634
that the benefits of Iron Man
far outweigh the liabilities.

174
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,886
- And that it would be in our interest...
- That's enough, Colonel.

175
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:03,137
To fold Mr. Stark...
- That's enough.

176
00:15:03,263 --> 00:15:04,764
Into the existing chain
of command, Senator.

177
00:15:04,848 --> 00:15:08,226
I'm not a joiner, but I'll consider
Secretary of Defense, if you ask nice.

178
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,979
We can amend the
hours a little bit.

179
00:15:11,647 --> 00:15:13,398
I'd like to go on
and show, if I may,

180
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:15,650
the imagery that's
connected to your report.

181
00:15:15,776 --> 00:15:18,611
I believe it is somewhat
premature to reveal these images

182
00:15:18,696 --> 00:15:20,488
- to the general public at this time.
- With all due respect,

183
00:15:20,614 --> 00:15:21,781
Colonel, I understand.

184
00:15:21,865 --> 00:15:25,952
And if you could just narrate those
for us, we'd be very grateful.

185
00:15:26,036 --> 00:15:27,996
Let's have the images.

186
00:15:29,456 --> 00:15:32,667
Intelligence suggests that the
devices seen in these photos

187
00:15:32,793 --> 00:15:35,628
are, in fact, attempts
at making manned copies

188
00:15:35,713 --> 00:15:37,171
of Mr. Stark's suit.

189
00:15:37,297 --> 00:15:42,301
This has been corroborated by our allies
and local intelligence on the ground,

190
00:15:42,386 --> 00:15:47,515
indicating that these suits are quite
possibly, at this moment, operational.

191
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:51,602
Hold on one second, buddy.
Let me see something here.

192
00:15:52,187 --> 00:15:55,189
Boy, I'm good. I
commandeered your screens.

193
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:58,693
I need them. Time for a
little transparency.

194
00:15:58,944 --> 00:16:00,695
- Now, let's see what's really going on.
- What is he doing?

195
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:04,032
If you will direct your
attention to said screens...

196
00:16:04,116 --> 00:16:05,700
I believe that's North Korea.

197
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:16,794
Can you turn that off?
Take it off.

198
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,046
Iran.

199
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:25,553
No grave immediate threat here.
Is that Justin Hammer?

200
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:28,097
How did Hammer get in the game?

201
00:16:28,891 --> 00:16:30,808
Justin, you're on TV. Focus up.

202
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:35,396
Okay, give me a left twist. Left's good.
Turn to the right.

203
00:16:37,775 --> 00:16:40,526
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

204
00:16:40,611 --> 00:16:41,778
Wow.

205
00:16:42,738 --> 00:16:46,532
Yeah, I'd say most countries,
five, 10 years away.

206
00:16:46,617 --> 00:16:47,909
Hammer Industries, 20.

207
00:16:47,993 --> 00:16:50,620
I'd like to point out that
that test pilot survived.

208
00:16:50,746 --> 00:16:52,246
I think we're done, is the
point that he's making.

209
00:16:52,331 --> 00:16:55,541
- I don't think there's any reason...
- The point is, you're welcome, I guess.

210
00:16:55,626 --> 00:16:58,461
- For what?
- Because I'm your nuclear deterrent.

211
00:16:58,587 --> 00:17:01,088
It's working. We're safe.
America is secure.

212
00:17:01,173 --> 00:17:03,090
You want my property?
You can't have it.

213
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:04,592
But I did you a big favour.

214
00:17:05,344 --> 00:17:08,262
I've successfully
privatized world peace.

215
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,643
What more do you want? For now!

216
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:17,313
I tried to play ball
with these ass-clowns.

217
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,775
You, Mr. Stark... you, buddy.

218
00:17:21,026 --> 00:17:22,985
We're adjourned. We're
adjourned for today.

219
00:17:23,111 --> 00:17:25,363
- Okay.
- You've been a delight.

220
00:17:31,203 --> 00:17:33,454
My bond is with the people.

221
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:38,793
And I will serve this great
nation at the pleasure of myself.

222
00:17:39,127 --> 00:17:40,461
If there's one thing I've proven

223
00:17:40,546 --> 00:17:43,881
it's that you can count
on me to pleasure myself.

224
00:18:19,585 --> 00:18:21,085
Wake up. Daddy's home.

225
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:22,753
Welcome home, sir.

226
00:18:22,838 --> 00:18:24,714
Congratulations on the
opening ceremonies.

227
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,842
They were such a success,
as was your Senate hearing.

228
00:18:27,926 --> 00:18:29,677
And may I say how
refreshing it is

229
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:33,514
to finally see you in a video
with your clothing on, sir.

230
00:18:35,434 --> 00:18:36,559
You!

231
00:18:37,185 --> 00:18:39,353
I swear to God I'll dismantle you.
I'll soak your motherboard.

232
00:18:39,438 --> 00:18:42,023
I'll turn you into a wine rack.

233
00:18:42,566 --> 00:18:44,775
How many ounces a day
of this gobbledegook

234
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,943
am I supposed to drink?

235
00:18:46,028 --> 00:18:50,031
We are up to 80 ounces a day to
counteract the symptoms, sir.

236
00:18:50,949 --> 00:18:52,950
Check palladium levels.

237
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,204
Blood toxicity, 24%.

238
00:18:58,707 --> 00:19:01,042
It appears that the continued
use of the Iron Man suit

239
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:03,544
is accelerating your condition.

240
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:07,423
Another core has been depleted.

241
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:12,470
God, they're running out quick.

242
00:19:12,554 --> 00:19:15,222
I have run simulations
on every known element,

243
00:19:15,307 --> 00:19:17,350
and none can serve as
a viable replacement

244
00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:19,435
for the palladium core.

245
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:24,732
You are running out of
both time and options.

246
00:19:28,445 --> 00:19:31,155
Unfortunately, the device
that's keeping you alive

247
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:33,074
is also killing you.

248
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:35,993
Miss Potts is approaching.

249
00:19:36,078 --> 00:19:38,996
- I recommend that you inform her...
- Mute.

250
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:43,668
Is this a joke?

251
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:46,754
- What are you thinking?
- What?

252
00:19:46,838 --> 00:19:49,131
- What are you thinking?
- Hey, I'm thinking I'm busy.

253
00:19:49,257 --> 00:19:51,550
And you're angry
about something.

254
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:53,010
Do you have the sniffles?
I don't wanna get sick.

255
00:19:53,095 --> 00:19:54,512
- Did you just donate...
- Keep your business.

256
00:19:54,596 --> 00:19:58,140
Our entire modern art
collection to the...

257
00:19:58,266 --> 00:19:59,850
- Boy Scouts of America.
...Boy Scouts of America?

258
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:01,727
Yes. It is a worthwhile
organisation.

259
00:20:01,812 --> 00:20:05,189
I didn't physically check the
crates but, basically, yes.

260
00:20:05,273 --> 00:20:07,441
And it's not "our" collection,
it's my collection. No of fence.

261
00:20:07,526 --> 00:20:09,568
No, you know what? I think
I'm actually entitled

262
00:20:09,653 --> 00:20:11,237
to say "our" collection

263
00:20:11,321 --> 00:20:14,532
considering the time that
I put in, over 10 years,

264
00:20:14,616 --> 00:20:16,450
- curating that.
- It was a tax write-off. I needed that.

265
00:20:16,535 --> 00:20:19,620
You know, there's only
about 8,011things

266
00:20:19,705 --> 00:20:21,664
that I really need to
talk to you about.

267
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,207
Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out.

268
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:24,750
The Bridgeport's already
machining that part.

269
00:20:24,835 --> 00:20:27,211
The Expo is a gigantic
waste of time.

270
00:20:27,295 --> 00:20:29,547
I need you to wear a surgical
mask until you're feeling better.

271
00:20:29,631 --> 00:20:30,798
- Is that okay?
- That's rude.

272
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,258
There's nothing more important
to me than the Expo.

273
00:20:32,342 --> 00:20:33,676
It's my primary
point of concern.

274
00:20:33,802 --> 00:20:36,929
- I don't know why you're...
- The Expo is your ego gone crazy.

275
00:20:37,014 --> 00:20:38,806
Wow. Look at that.

276
00:20:40,017 --> 00:20:42,393
That's modern art.
That's going up.

277
00:20:42,477 --> 00:20:45,229
- You've got to be kidding.
- I'm gonna put this up right now.

278
00:20:45,313 --> 00:20:47,523
- This is vital.
- Stark is in complete disarray.

279
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:50,026
- You understand that?
- No. Our stocks have never been higher.

280
00:20:50,027 --> 00:20:52,361
- Yes, from a managerial standpoint.
- You are... Well, if it's messy,

281
00:20:52,446 --> 00:20:53,946
- then let's double back.
- Let me give you an example.

282
00:20:54,031 --> 00:20:55,614
- Let's move on to another subject.
- No, no, no, no.

283
00:20:55,699 --> 00:20:57,408
You are not taking down
the Barnett Newman

284
00:20:57,492 --> 00:20:58,993
- and hanging that up!
- I'm not taking it down.

285
00:20:59,077 --> 00:21:00,357
I'm just replacing it with this.

286
00:21:00,412 --> 00:21:01,787
- Let's see what I can get going here.
- Okay, fine.

287
00:21:01,872 --> 00:21:04,999
My point is, we have
already awarded contracts

288
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,751
- to the wind farm people.
- Yeah. Don't say "wind farm."

289
00:21:06,835 --> 00:21:08,919
- I'm already feeling gassy.
- And to the plastic plantation tree,

290
00:21:09,004 --> 00:21:11,130
which was your idea, by the way.
Those people are on payroll...

291
00:21:11,214 --> 00:21:13,007
- Everything was my idea... and
you won't make a decision.

292
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:14,800
I don't care about the
liberal agenda any more.

293
00:21:14,885 --> 00:21:17,261
It's boring. Boring. I'm
giving you a boring alert.

294
00:21:17,345 --> 00:21:19,638
- You do it.
- I do what?

295
00:21:19,723 --> 00:21:21,682
Excellent idea. I just figured this out.
You run the company.

296
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:24,560
- Yeah, I'm trying to run the company.
- Pepper, I need you to run the company.

297
00:21:24,644 --> 00:21:26,062
- Well, stop trying to do it and do it.
- You will not

298
00:21:26,146 --> 00:21:27,813
- give me the information...
- I'm not asking you to try...

299
00:21:27,898 --> 00:21:29,098
in order to...
- I'm asking you

300
00:21:29,107 --> 00:21:30,316
to physically do it.
I need you to do it.

301
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,151
- I am trying to do it.
- Pepper, you're not listening to me!

302
00:21:32,235 --> 00:21:34,153
- No, you are not listening to me.
- I'm trying to make you CEO.

303
00:21:34,237 --> 00:21:36,113
Why won't you let me?

304
00:21:36,656 --> 00:21:39,658
- Have you been drinking?
- Chlorophyll.

305
00:21:41,578 --> 00:21:45,831
I hereby irrevocably appoint you
chairman and CEO of Stark Industries,

306
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,833
effective immediately.

307
00:21:50,003 --> 00:21:51,921
Yeah, done deal. Okay?

308
00:21:53,381 --> 00:21:55,966
I've actually given this a
fair amount of thought,

309
00:21:56,051 --> 00:21:59,970
believe it or not. Doing a bit
of headhunting, so to speak,

310
00:22:00,222 --> 00:22:03,933
trying to figure out who a
worthy successor would be.

311
00:22:04,017 --> 00:22:05,810
And then I realised

312
00:22:08,355 --> 00:22:10,898
it's you. It's always been you.

313
00:22:12,901 --> 00:22:14,026
I thought there'd
be a legal issue,

314
00:22:14,111 --> 00:22:17,571
but actually I'm capable of
appointing my successor.

315
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:20,282
My successor being you.

316
00:22:22,452 --> 00:22:24,120
Congratulations?

317
00:22:25,872 --> 00:22:27,456
- Take it, just take it.
- I don't know what to think.

318
00:22:27,541 --> 00:22:29,333
Don't think. Drink.

319
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,507
There you go.

320
00:23:16,256 --> 00:23:19,508
The notary's here! Can you please
come sign the transfer paperwork?

321
00:23:20,051 --> 00:23:21,802
I'm on happy time.

322
00:23:28,018 --> 00:23:29,351
- Sorry.
- What the hell was that?

323
00:23:29,352 --> 00:23:31,770
It's called mixed martial arts.
It's been around for three weeks.

324
00:23:31,855 --> 00:23:34,023
It's called dirty boxing.
There's nothing new about it.

325
00:23:34,024 --> 00:23:36,483
All right, put them up. Come on.

326
00:23:39,154 --> 00:23:44,033
I promise you this is the only time I
will ask you to sign over your company.

327
00:23:45,243 --> 00:23:47,620
I need you to initial each box.

328
00:23:48,205 --> 00:23:50,956
Lesson one. Never
take your eye off...

329
00:23:53,251 --> 00:23:54,460
That's it. I'm done.

330
00:23:54,544 --> 00:23:56,962
- What's your name, lady?
- Rushman. Natalie Rushman.

331
00:23:57,047 --> 00:23:58,631
Front and center.
Come into the church.

332
00:23:58,715 --> 00:24:02,509
- No. You're seriously not gonna ask...
- If it pleases the court, which it does.

333
00:24:02,594 --> 00:24:05,930
- It's no problem.
- I'm sorry. He's very eccentric.

334
00:24:19,486 --> 00:24:20,653
What?

335
00:24:24,407 --> 00:24:27,201
- Can you give her a lesson?
- No problem.

336
00:24:27,494 --> 00:24:29,286
- Pepper.
- What?

337
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:32,790
- Who is she?
- She is from legal.

338
00:24:32,874 --> 00:24:36,961
And she is potentially a very
expensive sexual harassment lawsuit

339
00:24:37,045 --> 00:24:39,213
- if you keep ogling her like that.
- I need a new assistant, boss.

340
00:24:39,297 --> 00:24:42,091
Yes, and I've got three
excellent potential candidates.

341
00:24:42,217 --> 00:24:43,801
They're lined up and
ready to meet you.

342
00:24:43,802 --> 00:24:45,229
I don't have time to meet.
I need someone now.

343
00:24:45,242 --> 00:24:46,679
I feel like it's her.

344
00:24:46,763 --> 00:24:47,846
No, it's not.

345
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:49,723
- You ever boxed before?
- I have, yes.

346
00:24:49,808 --> 00:24:53,769
What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot Camp?
Crunch? Something like that?

347
00:24:53,853 --> 00:24:57,606
- How do I spell your name, Natalie?
- R-U-S-H-M-A-N.

348
00:24:57,691 --> 00:25:02,111
- What, are you gonna Google her now?
- I thought I was ogling her.

349
00:25:02,195 --> 00:25:05,864
- Wow. Very, very impressive individual.
- You're so predictable, you know that?

350
00:25:05,949 --> 00:25:08,117
She's fluent in French,
Italian, Russian, Latin.

351
00:25:08,201 --> 00:25:10,077
- Who speaks Latin?
- No one speaks Latin.

352
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:12,454
- No one speaks Latin?
- It's a dead language.

353
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:14,331
You can read Latin or
you can write Latin,

354
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:16,000
- but you can't speak Latin...
- Did you model in Tokyo?

355
00:25:16,084 --> 00:25:17,835
- 'Cause she modeled in Tokyo.
- Well...

356
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,295
I need her. She's got
everything that I need.

357
00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:23,007
Rule number one, never take
your eye off your opponent.

358
00:25:24,217 --> 00:25:25,634
Oh, my God!

359
00:25:27,887 --> 00:25:30,639
- Happy!
- That's what I'm talking about.

360
00:25:30,724 --> 00:25:32,057
- I just slipped.
- You did?

361
00:25:32,142 --> 00:25:34,476
- Yeah.
- Looks like a TKO to me.

362
00:25:36,813 --> 00:25:39,023
Just... I need your impression.

363
00:25:39,107 --> 00:25:41,817
You have a quiet reserve. I don't
know, you have an old soul.

364
00:25:41,901 --> 00:25:44,403
- I meant your fingerprint.
- Right.

365
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,784
- So, how are we doing?
- Great. Just wrapping up. Hey.

366
00:25:52,037 --> 00:25:55,247
- You're the boss.
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?

367
00:25:55,332 --> 00:25:57,291
- No.
- Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman.

368
00:25:57,375 --> 00:25:59,209
Thank you very much.

369
00:26:02,213 --> 00:26:03,881
- I want one.
- No.

370
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:40,167
You know, it's Europe. Whatever
happens the next 20 minutes,

371
00:26:40,251 --> 00:26:41,502
- just go with it.
- Go with it? Go with what?

372
00:26:41,586 --> 00:26:43,128
- Mr. Stark?
- Hey.

373
00:26:43,213 --> 00:26:44,421
Hello. How was your flight?

374
00:26:44,506 --> 00:26:46,006
It was excellent. Boy,
it's nice to see you.

375
00:26:46,091 --> 00:26:50,260
We have one photographer from the
ACM, if you don't mind. Okay?

376
00:26:50,345 --> 00:26:52,429
- When did this happen?
- What? You made me do it.

377
00:26:52,514 --> 00:26:55,057
- I made you do what?
- You quit. Smile. Look right there.

378
00:26:55,141 --> 00:26:56,266
Stop acting constipated.

379
00:26:56,351 --> 00:26:57,810
- Don't flare your nostrils.
- You are so predictable.

380
00:26:57,894 --> 00:26:58,936
- That's the amazing thing.
- Right this way.

381
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,729
- You look fantastic.
- Why, thank you very much.

382
00:27:00,814 --> 00:27:02,731
But that's unprofessional.
What's on the docket?

383
00:27:02,732 --> 00:27:04,650
You have a 9: 30 dinner.

384
00:27:04,734 --> 00:27:06,485
- Perfect. I'll be there at 11: 00.
- Absolutely.

385
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:08,404
- Is this us?
- It can be.

386
00:27:08,488 --> 00:27:10,155
- Great. Make it us.
- Okay.

387
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,699
- Mr. Musk. How are you?
- Hi, Pepper.

388
00:27:12,784 --> 00:27:14,660
- Congratulations on the promotion.
- Thank you very much.

389
00:27:14,744 --> 00:27:16,995
Elon, how's it going? Those
Merlin engines are fantastic.

390
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,081
Thank you. Yeah, I've got an
idea for an electric jet.

391
00:27:19,165 --> 00:27:20,249
- You do?
- Yeah.

392
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,376
Then we'll make it work.

393
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,211
- You want a massage?
- Oh, God. No,

394
00:27:24,295 --> 00:27:25,754
- I don't want a massage.
- I'll have Natalie make an...

395
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:27,256
- I don't want Natalie to do...
- Don't want you tense.

396
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,507
By the way, I didn't mean
to spring this on you.

397
00:27:28,591 --> 00:27:29,716
Thank you very much.

398
00:27:29,801 --> 00:27:31,760
- Green is not your best colour.
- Oh, please.

399
00:27:31,845 --> 00:27:33,387
Anthony! Is that you?

400
00:27:33,471 --> 00:27:34,763
- My least favourite person on Earth.
- Hey, pal.

401
00:27:34,848 --> 00:27:36,140
- Justin Hammer.
- How you doing?

402
00:27:36,224 --> 00:27:39,017
You're not the only rich
guy here with a fancy car.

403
00:27:39,102 --> 00:27:41,520
You know Christine
Everhart from Vanity Fair.

404
00:27:41,604 --> 00:27:42,813
- You guys know each other?
- Hi.

405
00:27:42,814 --> 00:27:44,064
- Yes.
- Yes.

406
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:45,315
- Yes, roughly.
- We do.

407
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,445
BTW, big story. The new
CEO of Stark Industries.

408
00:27:49,529 --> 00:27:50,850
- I know. I know.
- Congratulations.

409
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:54,366
My editor will kill me if I don't grab
a quote for our Powerful Women issue.

410
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:55,617
- Can I?
- Sure.

411
00:27:55,702 --> 00:27:58,203
She's actually doing a big
spread on me for Vanity Fair.

412
00:27:58,288 --> 00:28:00,205
I thought I'd throw
her a bone, you know.

413
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,373
- Right.
- Right?

414
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:04,835
Well, she did quite a
spread on Tony last year.

415
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,253
And she wrote a story as well.

416
00:28:06,337 --> 00:28:08,380
- It was very impressive.
- That was good.

417
00:28:08,465 --> 00:28:10,507
- Very well done.
- Thank you.

418
00:28:10,592 --> 00:28:12,072
- I'm gonna go wash.
- Don't leave me.

419
00:28:12,135 --> 00:28:13,594
- Hey, buddy. How you doing?
- I'm all right.

420
00:28:13,678 --> 00:28:14,970
- Looking gorgeous.
- Please, this is tough.

421
00:28:15,054 --> 00:28:16,356
Can I ask you... Is
this the first time...

422
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:17,681
Fromage.

423
00:28:17,765 --> 00:28:19,266
- Say, "Brie." ...that you
guys have seen each other?

424
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,602
God, that's so awful.

425
00:28:21,686 --> 00:28:24,062
Listen, is it the first time you've
seen each other since the Senate?

426
00:28:24,147 --> 00:28:25,814
Since he got his
contract revoked...

427
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:28,180
- Actually, it's on hold... when
you were attempting to...

428
00:28:28,193 --> 00:28:30,194
That's not what I heard. What's
the difference between "hold"

429
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:32,112
- and "cancelled"? The truth?
- Yes, what is?

430
00:28:32,197 --> 00:28:34,573
No. The truth is... Why
don't we put that away?

431
00:28:34,657 --> 00:28:38,660
The truth is, I'm actually hoping
to present something at your Expo.

432
00:28:38,745 --> 00:28:41,121
Well, if you invent
something that works,

433
00:28:41,206 --> 00:28:42,623
I'll make sure I get you a slot.

434
00:28:42,707 --> 00:28:44,917
- Mr. Stark, your corner table is ready.
- Yes?

435
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:47,211
I actually have a slot this year.
Yes, I do.

436
00:28:47,295 --> 00:28:50,464
- Hammer needs a slot, Christine.
- We kid, yeah.

437
00:28:51,341 --> 00:28:52,508
We kid. We're kidders.

438
00:29:14,864 --> 00:29:16,907
Got any other bad ideas?

439
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,287
Tony!

440
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:30,420
Tony and I... Tony... I love Tony Stark.
Tony loves me. We're not competitors.

441
00:29:30,505 --> 00:29:32,965
Him being out of the picture
created tremendous opportunities

442
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:35,551
for Hammer Industries, you know?

443
00:29:35,635 --> 00:29:38,971
- Everything that Tony and I do...
- Well, what's the use of having...

444
00:29:39,055 --> 00:29:41,932
is a healthy... and
owning a race car...

445
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,977
competition... if
you don't drive it?

446
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,563
Is he driving?

447
00:29:54,821 --> 00:29:56,530
Natalie. Natalie!

448
00:29:57,448 --> 00:29:58,657
- Yes, Miss Potts?
- Did you know about this?

449
00:29:58,741 --> 00:30:00,951
This is the first that
I have known of it.

450
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:02,786
This... This cannot happen.

451
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,538
Absolutely. I understand.
How can I help you?

452
00:30:04,622 --> 00:30:05,872
- Where's Happy?
- He's waiting outside.

453
00:30:05,957 --> 00:30:07,833
- Okay, get him. I need Happy.
- Right away.

454
00:30:08,585 --> 00:30:10,711
Tony's... You know, he...

455
00:30:10,795 --> 00:30:12,671
We're not competitive.
You know what I mean?

456
00:30:12,755 --> 00:30:13,839
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,

457
00:30:13,923 --> 00:30:16,883
- can you excuse me just one second?
- Just read me what you wrote.

458
00:30:16,968 --> 00:30:18,176
- I will. I will, after.
- Just read it back to me.

459
00:30:18,261 --> 00:30:19,511
But I have to make one
quick phone call.

460
00:30:19,596 --> 00:30:20,679
- Where are you going?
- This is great.

461
00:30:20,763 --> 00:30:22,139
- I've got some caviar coming.
- This is great stuff.

462
00:30:22,223 --> 00:30:23,724
- I'll be right back.
- Look!

463
00:30:23,808 --> 00:30:25,309
That's Stark.

464
00:32:23,302 --> 00:32:24,553
Go, go!

465
00:32:28,141 --> 00:32:29,433
Hang on.

466
00:33:38,377 --> 00:33:40,212
- Give me the case.
- Here. Take it.

467
00:33:40,296 --> 00:33:41,880
- Where's the key?
- It's in my pocket.

468
00:33:41,964 --> 00:33:43,131
Car!

469
00:34:46,779 --> 00:34:48,196
Oh, my God!

470
00:34:54,787 --> 00:34:57,330
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

471
00:34:58,165 --> 00:35:00,333
- Were you heading for me or him?
- I was trying to scare him.

472
00:35:00,418 --> 00:35:02,419
- 'Cause I can't tell!
- Are you out of your mind?

473
00:35:02,503 --> 00:35:04,462
- Better security.
- Get in the car right now!

474
00:35:04,547 --> 00:35:06,298
I was attacked! We
need better security.

475
00:35:06,382 --> 00:35:08,633
- Get in the car!
- You're CEO. Better security measures.

476
00:35:08,718 --> 00:35:10,468
God, it's embarrassing.

477
00:35:11,304 --> 00:35:13,555
First vacation in two years.

478
00:35:18,227 --> 00:35:19,644
Oh, my God!

479
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,981
- I got him!
- Hit him again. Hit him again.

480
00:35:23,065 --> 00:35:24,941
Football.

481
00:35:27,403 --> 00:35:29,446
- I got him!
- Take the case! Take it!

482
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,197
- Take the case!
- Give him the case!

483
00:35:31,282 --> 00:35:33,116
Stop banging the car!

484
00:35:36,245 --> 00:35:37,621
Calm down.

485
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:40,540
God! God!

486
00:35:43,127 --> 00:35:51,127
Give me the case! Please!
Come on!

487
00:37:18,264 --> 00:37:19,931
You... You lose.

488
00:37:26,272 --> 00:37:28,898
You lose. You lose, Stark.

489
00:38:22,453 --> 00:38:26,122
Pretty decent tech. Cycles per
second were a little low.

490
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:34,798
You could have doubled
up your rotations.

491
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,261
You focused the repulsor energy
through ionized plasma channels.

492
00:38:40,346 --> 00:38:43,264
It's effective. Not
very efficient.

493
00:38:44,308 --> 00:38:46,643
But it's a passable knock-off.

494
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:48,853
I don't get it. A
little fine tuning,

495
00:38:48,938 --> 00:38:50,730
you could have made
a solid paycheck.

496
00:38:50,815 --> 00:38:54,984
You could have sold it to
North Korea, China, Iran,

497
00:38:55,069 --> 00:38:57,695
or gone right to
the black market.

498
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,740
You look like you got
friends in low places.

499
00:39:00,825 --> 00:39:06,371
You come from a family
of thieves and butchers.

500
00:39:07,748 --> 00:39:10,041
And now, like all guilty men,

501
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,586
you try to rewrite
your own history.

502
00:39:14,255 --> 00:39:19,259
And you forget all the lives the
Stark family has destroyed.

503
00:39:20,427 --> 00:39:23,680
Speaking of thieves, where
did you get this design?

504
00:39:23,764 --> 00:39:26,683
My father. Anton Vanko.

505
00:39:27,893 --> 00:39:30,061
Well, I never heard of him.

506
00:39:31,146 --> 00:39:33,857
My father is the
reason you're alive.

507
00:39:34,108 --> 00:39:36,109
The reason I'm alive is 'cause
you had a shot, you took it,

508
00:39:36,193 --> 00:39:37,735
you missed.

509
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,028
Did I?

510
00:39:41,907 --> 00:39:44,033
If you can make God bleed,

511
00:39:45,035 --> 00:39:47,912
the people will cease
to believe in him.

512
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:53,585
And there will be blood in the water.
And the sharks will come.

513
00:39:55,588 --> 00:40:00,008
The truth, all I have to
do is sit here and watch

514
00:40:00,092 --> 00:40:02,594
as the world will consume you.

515
00:40:02,678 --> 00:40:04,762
Where will you be watching
the world consume me from?

516
00:40:04,847 --> 00:40:08,766
That's right. A prison cell.
I'll send you a bar of soap.

517
00:40:08,851 --> 00:40:11,144
Hey, Tony. Before you go,

518
00:40:11,228 --> 00:40:14,606
palladium in the chest,
painful way to die.

519
00:40:32,041 --> 00:40:35,501
It's just unbelievable. It proves
that the genie is out of the bottle

520
00:40:35,586 --> 00:40:38,046
and this man has no
idea what he's doing.

521
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:41,883
He thinks of the Iron
Man weapon as a toy.

522
00:40:41,967 --> 00:40:46,804
I was at a hearing where
Mr. Stark, in fact, was adamant

523
00:40:46,889 --> 00:40:50,516
that these suits can't
exist anywhere else,

524
00:40:50,601 --> 00:40:53,144
don't exist anywhere else, never
will exist anywhere else,

525
00:40:53,228 --> 00:40:54,562
at least for five to 10 years,

526
00:40:54,647 --> 00:40:59,275
and here we are in Monaco
realising, "These suits exist now."

527
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,526
Mute.

528
00:41:02,821 --> 00:41:06,115
He should be giving me a medal.
That's the truth.

529
00:41:09,662 --> 00:41:13,456
- What is that?
- This is your in-flight meal.

530
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,628
Did you just make that?

531
00:41:18,712 --> 00:41:22,131
Yeah. Where do you think
I've been for three hours?

532
00:41:23,133 --> 00:41:24,300
Tony,

533
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,721
what are you not telling me?

534
00:41:32,643 --> 00:41:35,645
I don't want to go home. At all.

535
00:41:37,898 --> 00:41:40,608
Let's cancel my
birthday party and...

536
00:41:40,693 --> 00:41:43,277
We're in Europe. Let's
go to Venice, Cipriani.

537
00:41:43,362 --> 00:41:44,570
- Remember?
- Oh, yes.

538
00:41:44,655 --> 00:41:46,531
It's a great place to

539
00:41:49,034 --> 00:41:52,161
- be healthy.
- I don't think this is the right time.

540
00:41:52,246 --> 00:41:54,497
We're in kind of a mess.

541
00:41:54,581 --> 00:41:56,207
Yeah, but maybe that's
why it's the best time.

542
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:58,334
- 'Cause then we...
- Well, I think as the CEO,

543
00:41:58,419 --> 00:41:59,544
I need to show up.

544
00:41:59,628 --> 00:42:03,923
As CEO, you are
entitled to a leave.

545
00:42:04,008 --> 00:42:05,341
- A leave?
- A company retreat.

546
00:42:05,426 --> 00:42:07,969
- A retreat? During a time like this?
- Just a ride.

547
00:42:08,053 --> 00:42:11,639
Well, I'm just saying, to recharge
our batteries and figure it all out.

548
00:42:11,724 --> 00:42:14,475
Not everybody runs
on batteries, Tony.

549
00:44:26,441 --> 00:44:28,568
Hey, there he is.

550
00:44:29,278 --> 00:44:30,736
There he is.

551
00:44:32,656 --> 00:44:35,825
What an absolute pleasure.
Welcome.

552
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:37,952
Oh, goodness gracious.

553
00:44:38,078 --> 00:44:41,581
Can we get the handcuffs
off my friend here?

554
00:44:41,665 --> 00:44:45,168
Forgive me, I'm sorry. I'm
such a huge fan of yours.

555
00:44:45,252 --> 00:44:49,046
I didn't want to make a
first impression like this.

556
00:44:49,131 --> 00:44:51,424
He's not an animal. Come on.

557
00:44:52,301 --> 00:44:54,969
He's a human being. Thank you.

558
00:45:00,017 --> 00:45:01,434
We're fine.

559
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,770
My name is Justin Hammer.

560
00:45:04,855 --> 00:45:08,191
I'd like to do some business with you.
Please sit.

561
00:45:11,945 --> 00:45:14,405
Dig in. What do we
have today, Jack?

562
00:45:14,489 --> 00:45:17,825
- We have some salmon carpaccio.
- Salmon carpaccio.

563
00:45:19,286 --> 00:45:21,120
Anything you want
here, we got it.

564
00:45:21,205 --> 00:45:25,291
I like my dessert first. I had
this flown in from San Francisco.

565
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,251
It's Italian, though.

566
00:45:27,336 --> 00:45:29,128
Organic ice cream.

567
00:45:29,213 --> 00:45:33,132
I got a sweet tooth. Apparently
you do, too, for Tony Stark.

568
00:45:35,052 --> 00:45:37,845
What I saw you do to Tony
Stark on that track,

569
00:45:37,971 --> 00:45:41,599
how you stepped up to him in
front of God and everybody,

570
00:45:41,683 --> 00:45:43,809
that was... Wow!

571
00:45:43,894 --> 00:45:45,436
You spoke to me
with what you did.

572
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,147
And I know that you knew
that I'd be listening.

573
00:45:48,232 --> 00:45:49,774
This is why I couldn't bear
to have you shipped off

574
00:45:49,858 --> 00:45:52,652
to God knows where. It would have
been such a waste of talent.

575
00:45:52,736 --> 00:45:54,070
But if I might
make a suggestion,

576
00:45:54,154 --> 00:45:56,864
you know, you don't just go
and try and kill the guy.

577
00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:01,202
I think, if I may, you
go after his legacy.

578
00:46:01,328 --> 00:46:03,371
That's what you kill.

579
00:46:03,497 --> 00:46:06,457
You and me, we are a lot
alike in a lot of ways.

580
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:11,170
The only difference between you
and I is that I have resources.

581
00:46:12,005 --> 00:46:14,423
I think, if I may,

582
00:46:14,508 --> 00:46:16,842
you need my resources.

583
00:46:16,927 --> 00:46:19,512
Someone behind
you, a benefactor.

584
00:46:19,596 --> 00:46:21,681
I'd like to be that guy.

585
00:46:33,568 --> 00:46:37,863
Okay. Do you speak English?
Because I can get a translator.

586
00:46:37,948 --> 00:46:40,783
I don't know. Have you been
understanding everything I'm saying?

587
00:46:40,867 --> 00:46:42,285
Very good, man.

588
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:45,538
- Very good, man.
- Very good, man.

589
00:46:45,622 --> 00:46:46,747
Hey!

590
00:46:48,292 --> 00:46:50,459
- Hey.
- Yes?

591
00:46:50,544 --> 00:46:52,128
I want my bird.

592
00:46:54,131 --> 00:46:57,800
- A bird? You want a bird?
- I want my bird.

593
00:46:57,884 --> 00:46:59,552
I can get you a bird. I
can get you 10 birds.

594
00:46:59,636 --> 00:47:01,178
I want my bird.

595
00:47:01,263 --> 00:47:03,806
Well, okay. Nothing's impossible.
I could...

596
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:07,560
Are we talking about... Is
this a bird back in Russia?

597
00:47:07,644 --> 00:47:10,688
Yes, but the fundamentals of the
company are still very, very strong

598
00:47:10,772 --> 00:47:12,692
- despite the events in Monaco.
- Yes, of course.

599
00:47:12,774 --> 00:47:16,235
- The AP wants a quote.
- Don't tell him. Fax them...

600
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,820
Where is he?

601
00:47:17,904 --> 00:47:19,697
- He doesn't want to be disturbed.
- He's downstairs.

602
00:47:19,781 --> 00:47:21,261
What happened in Monaco?
- Yes, but...

603
00:47:21,325 --> 00:47:23,826
But his continuing
erratic behaviour

604
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:26,037
may lead many people
to ask themselves,

605
00:47:26,121 --> 00:47:27,955
"Can this man still protect us?"

606
00:47:28,081 --> 00:47:31,334
Iron Man never stopped protecting us.
The events in Monaco proved that.

607
00:47:32,627 --> 00:47:37,006
Query complete, sir. Anton
Vanko was a Soviet physicist

608
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:40,092
who defected to the
United States in 1963.

609
00:47:40,177 --> 00:47:44,347
However, he was accused of espionage
and was deported in 1967.

610
00:47:44,431 --> 00:47:46,807
His son, Ivan, who
is also a physicist,

611
00:47:46,933 --> 00:47:51,645
was convicted of selling Soviet-era
weapons-grade plutonium to Pakistan,

612
00:47:51,772 --> 00:47:54,231
and served 15 years
in Kopeisk prison.

613
00:47:54,316 --> 00:47:56,442
No further records exist.

614
00:48:00,989 --> 00:48:02,615
Tony, you gotta get upstairs

615
00:48:02,699 --> 00:48:04,950
and get on top of this
situation right now.

616
00:48:05,035 --> 00:48:08,037
Listen. I've been on the phone
with the National Guard all day,

617
00:48:09,373 --> 00:48:12,208
trying to talk them out of
rolling tanks up the PCH,

618
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:15,169
knocking down your front
door and taking these.

619
00:48:15,295 --> 00:48:17,296
They're gonna take your
suits, Tony, okay?

620
00:48:17,381 --> 00:48:19,298
They're sick of the games.

621
00:48:19,383 --> 00:48:22,593
You said nobody else would possess
this technology for 20 years.

622
00:48:22,677 --> 00:48:25,888
Well, guess what? Somebody
else had it yesterday.

623
00:48:25,972 --> 00:48:28,307
It's not theoretical any more.

624
00:48:29,518 --> 00:48:31,560
Are you listening to me?

625
00:48:33,688 --> 00:48:35,314
- Are you okay?
- Let's go.

626
00:48:39,694 --> 00:48:42,238
Hey, man. Hey, hey!

627
00:48:44,574 --> 00:48:47,952
- You all right?
- Yeah, I should get to my desk.

628
00:48:48,036 --> 00:48:50,162
- See that cigar box?
- Yeah.

629
00:48:50,539 --> 00:48:52,164
It's palladium.

630
00:48:59,172 --> 00:49:00,631
Is that supposed to be smoking?

631
00:49:00,715 --> 00:49:05,010
If you must know, it's neutron damage.
It's from the reactor wall.

632
00:49:08,723 --> 00:49:10,850
You had this in your body?

633
00:49:15,689 --> 00:49:19,525
And how about the high-tech
crossword puzzle on your neck?

634
00:49:19,609 --> 00:49:21,026
Road rash.

635
00:49:24,406 --> 00:49:25,781
Thank you.

636
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:40,713
- What are you looking at?
- I'm looking at you.

637
00:49:40,797 --> 00:49:43,841
You wanna do this whole
lone gunslinger act

638
00:49:43,925 --> 00:49:46,051
and it's unnecessary. You
don't have to do this alone.

639
00:49:46,052 --> 00:49:48,262
You know, I wish I could believe that.
I really do.

640
00:49:48,388 --> 00:49:50,598
But you've gotta trust me.

641
00:49:50,724 --> 00:49:54,476
Contrary to popular belief, I
know exactly what I'm doing.

642
00:50:03,236 --> 00:50:05,529
This is where we do it.
This is my humble abode.

643
00:50:05,614 --> 00:50:09,074
You can work in absolute peace.
Must be fun to be dead, right?

644
00:50:09,159 --> 00:50:10,576
No pressure.

645
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:13,662
Here they are. I'm very excited.
They're combat-ready.

646
00:50:13,747 --> 00:50:15,227
I may have done a
few miscalculations

647
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:17,291
and rushed the prototype
into production.

648
00:50:17,417 --> 00:50:19,251
Sue me, I'm enthusiastic.

649
00:50:19,336 --> 00:50:21,629
Go ahead, take a look around.

650
00:50:26,426 --> 00:50:28,344
You don't wanna do that.

651
00:50:28,428 --> 00:50:30,054
You'll be able to access that

652
00:50:30,138 --> 00:50:32,058
as soon as we generate
some encrypted pass codes.

653
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,225
Can we generate some
encrypted pass codes?

654
00:50:34,309 --> 00:50:37,436
Get some of those encrypted
pass codes, Jack.

655
00:50:38,605 --> 00:50:40,272
Never mind, I...

656
00:50:41,524 --> 00:50:44,818
Wow. Okay. Good stuff.

657
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,615
- Sorry?
- Software shit.

658
00:50:51,868 --> 00:50:53,118
Well...

659
00:50:54,621 --> 00:50:56,038
You're good.

660
00:50:56,289 --> 00:50:59,458
You really blasted in
past the firewall there.

661
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:03,587
Let me show you where you're
gonna be working primarily.

662
00:51:03,672 --> 00:51:05,631
Go ahead, take a look.

663
00:51:06,508 --> 00:51:09,134
Get a good look at that.
That's something, isn't it?

664
00:51:09,219 --> 00:51:11,220
You know, those are really
just for show and tell.

665
00:51:11,304 --> 00:51:16,308
They're $125.7 million a pop, so...
Wait! Oh, gosh.

666
00:51:18,395 --> 00:51:21,313
Jesus Christ. Get
somebody up here.

667
00:51:22,148 --> 00:51:24,733
That's where the pilot goes.

668
00:51:24,818 --> 00:51:28,862
I'm having a tough time
finding volunteers.

669
00:51:28,989 --> 00:51:32,116
I'll take care of
that, just leave it.

670
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,701
What you want them do?

671
00:51:33,827 --> 00:51:38,998
Well, long term, I want them to put me
in the Pentagon for the next 25 years.

672
00:51:39,082 --> 00:51:41,125
I want to make Iron Man
look like an antique.

673
00:51:41,209 --> 00:51:42,418
I wanna go to that Stark Expo,

674
00:51:42,419 --> 00:51:44,336
I wanna take a dump
in Tony's front yard.

675
00:51:44,421 --> 00:51:45,838
You know what I'm talking about?

676
00:51:45,922 --> 00:51:48,090
- I can do that. No problem.
- Yeah?

677
00:51:48,174 --> 00:51:50,342
Hey, fabulous! I love it.

678
00:51:50,427 --> 00:51:53,137
Hey, this is our guy. Didn't I tell you?
I had a feeling.

679
00:52:02,731 --> 00:52:05,190
Do you know which watch you'd
like to wear tonight, Mr. Stark?

680
00:52:05,525 --> 00:52:07,526
I'll give them a look.

681
00:52:10,405 --> 00:52:11,864
I should cancel the party.

682
00:52:12,949 --> 00:52:14,199
- Probably.
- Yeah.

683
00:52:14,284 --> 00:52:16,910
- 'Cause it's...
- Ill-timed.

684
00:52:17,037 --> 00:52:18,495
Right, sends the wrong message.

685
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,080
Inappropriate.

686
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,213
Is that dirty enough for you?

687
00:52:29,215 --> 00:52:32,968
Gold face, brown band. The Jaeger.
I'll give that a look.

688
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:34,928
Bring them over here.

689
00:52:38,224 --> 00:52:40,392
I'll take that. Why don't you...

690
00:52:52,447 --> 00:52:54,782
I gotta say it. It's hard
to get a read on you.

691
00:52:55,075 --> 00:52:57,242
- Where are you from?
- Legal.

692
00:52:59,954 --> 00:53:02,081
Can I ask you a question,
hypothetically?

693
00:53:02,165 --> 00:53:03,457
Bit odd.

694
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:07,127
If this was your last birthday
party you were ever gonna have,

695
00:53:07,253 --> 00:53:08,796
how would you celebrate it?

696
00:53:11,466 --> 00:53:15,636
I'd do whatever I wanted to do with
whoever I wanted to do it with.

697
00:53:46,292 --> 00:53:48,460
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

698
00:53:49,379 --> 00:53:51,338
Yes, sir, I understand.

699
00:53:51,965 --> 00:53:55,676
No. No, sir, that will not be necessary.
I'll handle it.

700
00:53:55,802 --> 00:53:58,095
Sir, I personally guarantee
that within 24 hours,

701
00:53:58,179 --> 00:54:00,013
Iron Man will be back on watch.

702
00:54:07,313 --> 00:54:08,814
Hey, Pepper.

703
00:54:09,149 --> 00:54:11,233
I'm going to go get some air.

704
00:54:11,317 --> 00:54:12,693
What's wrong?

705
00:54:13,486 --> 00:54:15,821
- I don't know what to do.
- You gotta be kidding me.

706
00:54:21,995 --> 00:54:24,636
- That's it. I'm making... Pepper.
- No, no, no. Don't call anyone.

707
00:54:24,706 --> 00:54:26,623
This is ridiculous. I just stuck
my neck out for this guy.

708
00:54:26,708 --> 00:54:27,958
I know. I know. I get it.

709
00:54:28,042 --> 00:54:29,293
I'm gonna handle it, okay?
Just let me handle it.

710
00:54:29,377 --> 00:54:32,337
Handle it. Or I'm gonna have to.

711
00:54:33,506 --> 00:54:35,174
You know, the question I
get asked most often is,

712
00:54:35,258 --> 00:54:37,759
"Tony, how do you go to the
bathroom in the suit?"

713
00:54:41,181 --> 00:54:42,598
Just like that.

714
00:54:46,227 --> 00:54:49,188
Does this guy know how to
throw a party or what?

715
00:54:52,859 --> 00:54:53,901
I love you.

716
00:54:54,027 --> 00:54:56,653
Unbelievable! Thank you so much.

717
00:54:56,738 --> 00:55:00,699
Tony, we all thank you so much
for such a wonderful night.

718
00:55:00,783 --> 00:55:04,786
And we're gonna say good night
now, and thank you all for coming.

719
00:55:04,871 --> 00:55:06,079
No, no, no, we can't...
Wait, wait, wait.

720
00:55:06,206 --> 00:55:07,956
We didn't have the cake. We
didn't blow out the candles.

721
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:10,834
You're out of control, okay?
Trust me on this one, okay?

722
00:55:10,919 --> 00:55:13,253
- You're out of control, gorgeous.
- It's time to go to bed. It's time.

723
00:55:13,379 --> 00:55:14,463
- Give me another smooch.
- You're not going to be

724
00:55:14,547 --> 00:55:15,756
- happy about this.
- Come on, you know you want to.

725
00:55:15,882 --> 00:55:17,216
You just peed the suit.

726
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,759
- I know. It has a filtration system.
- It's not sexy.

727
00:55:18,885 --> 00:55:20,260
You could drink that water.

728
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,931
Just send everybody home, okay?
It's time to...

729
00:55:24,057 --> 00:55:25,766
- If you say so.
- Okay.

730
00:55:25,892 --> 00:55:28,060
I'll take this, you take that.

731
00:55:29,437 --> 00:55:31,063
Pepper Potts.

732
00:55:32,398 --> 00:55:33,899
She's right. The party's over.

733
00:55:33,983 --> 00:55:36,944
Then again, the party was over for
me, like, an hour and a half ago.

734
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:40,572
The after-party
starts in 15 minutes.

735
00:55:44,118 --> 00:55:48,288
And if anybody, Pepper, doesn't
like it, there's the door.

736
00:55:54,754 --> 00:55:56,129
Yeah!

737
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:01,760
Hit!

738
00:56:08,935 --> 00:56:09,435
Pull!

739
00:56:29,622 --> 00:56:31,790
I think she wants the Gallagher!

740
00:56:41,134 --> 00:56:43,051
I'm only gonna say this once.

741
00:56:46,556 --> 00:56:47,889
Get out.

742
00:56:54,397 --> 00:56:57,482
You don't deserve to wear one of these.
Shut it down!

743
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:00,277
Goldstein.

744
00:57:01,529 --> 00:57:02,738
Yes, Mr. Stark?

745
00:57:02,822 --> 00:57:06,074
Give me a phat beat to
beat my buddy's ass to.

746
00:57:09,871 --> 00:57:11,872
I told you to shut it down.

747
00:57:22,383 --> 00:57:25,969
Now, put that thing back where you
found it before someone gets hurt.

748
00:57:32,685 --> 00:57:33,935
Really?

749
00:57:41,736 --> 00:57:45,322
Sorry, pal, but Iron Man
doesn't have a sidekick.

750
00:57:45,907 --> 00:57:48,158
Sidekick this!

751
00:57:56,668 --> 00:57:58,168
Had enough?

752
00:57:59,087 --> 00:58:00,545
- Natalie!
- Miss Potts.

753
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:02,756
Don't you "Miss Potts" me!
I'm on to you.

754
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,883
You know what? Ever
since you came here...

755
00:58:08,596 --> 00:58:09,638
Pepper!

756
00:58:11,182 --> 00:58:12,516
Get out of here.
Get out of here.

757
00:58:18,773 --> 00:58:21,525
You want it? Take it!

758
00:59:02,775 --> 00:59:03,984
Put your hand down.

759
00:59:04,068 --> 00:59:06,278
You think you got what it
takes to wear that suit?

760
00:59:06,362 --> 00:59:07,654
We don't have to do this, Tony.

761
00:59:07,947 --> 00:59:09,614
You wanna be the War
Machine, take your shot.

762
00:59:09,699 --> 00:59:11,533
- Put it down!
- You gonna take a shot?

763
00:59:11,617 --> 00:59:12,868
- Put it down!
- No!

764
00:59:12,952 --> 00:59:14,411
- Drop it, Tony!
- Take it.

765
01:00:25,441 --> 01:00:27,859
Edwards Tower, this is
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes,

766
01:00:27,944 --> 01:00:31,154
inbound from three miles
east at 5,000 feet...

767
01:01:15,575 --> 01:01:16,908
Colonel.

768
01:01:17,869 --> 01:01:19,119
Major.

769
01:01:19,871 --> 01:01:20,996
Wow.

770
01:01:22,206 --> 01:01:23,498
Yeah.

771
01:01:25,334 --> 01:01:27,252
Let's take it inside.

772
01:01:27,336 --> 01:01:28,837
Clear the area.

773
01:01:51,611 --> 01:01:52,819
Sir!

774
01:01:52,904 --> 01:01:55,363
I'm gonna have to ask you
to exit the doughnut.

775
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:01,651
I told you I don't wanna join
your super-secret boy band.

776
01:02:02,455 --> 01:02:06,124
No, no, no. See, I remember,
you do everything yourself.

777
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:09,419
- How's that working out for you?
- It's... It's... It's...

778
01:02:10,922 --> 01:02:12,255
I'm sorry. I don't wanna
get off on the wrong foot.

779
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:14,132
Do I look at the
patch or the eye?

780
01:02:15,259 --> 01:02:16,343
Honestly, I'm a bit hung over.

781
01:02:16,427 --> 01:02:18,762
I'm not sure if you're
real or if I'm having...

782
01:02:18,846 --> 01:02:20,931
I am very real.

783
01:02:21,015 --> 01:02:23,016
I'm the realest person
you're ever gonna meet.

784
01:02:23,517 --> 01:02:26,770
- Just my luck. Where's the staff here?
- That's not looking so good.

785
01:02:27,521 --> 01:02:29,522
I've been worse.

786
01:02:31,192 --> 01:02:32,317
We've secured the perimeter,

787
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:35,195
but I don't think we should
hold it for too much longer.

788
01:02:38,783 --> 01:02:41,618
- You're fired.
- That's not up to you.

789
01:02:42,328 --> 01:02:45,538
Tony, I want you to
meet Agent Romanoff.

790
01:02:45,623 --> 01:02:46,748
- Hi.
- I'm a S.H.I.E.I.D. shadow.

791
01:02:46,832 --> 01:02:49,459
Once we knew you were ill, I was
tasked to you by Director Fury.

792
01:02:49,543 --> 01:02:51,378
I suggest you apologise.

793
01:02:51,462 --> 01:02:53,004
You've been very busy.

794
01:02:53,089 --> 01:02:56,341
You made your girl your CEO,
you're giving away all your stuff.

795
01:02:56,425 --> 01:02:59,427
You let your friend fly
away with your suit.

796
01:02:59,512 --> 01:03:00,887
Now, if I didn't know better...

797
01:03:00,972 --> 01:03:02,973
You don't know better. I didn't
give it to him. He took it.

798
01:03:03,057 --> 01:03:05,725
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it?

799
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:09,020
You're Iron Man and
he just took it?

800
01:03:09,105 --> 01:03:11,905
The little brother walked in there,
kicked your ass and took your suit?

801
01:03:11,983 --> 01:03:13,191
Is that possible?

802
01:03:13,275 --> 01:03:15,902
Well, according to Mr. Stark's
database security guidelines,

803
01:03:15,987 --> 01:03:18,989
there are redundancies to
prevent unauthorised usage.

804
01:03:21,784 --> 01:03:24,411
- What do you want from me?
- What do we want from you?

805
01:03:24,495 --> 01:03:26,371
What do you want from me?

806
01:03:26,455 --> 01:03:30,125
You have become a problem, a
problem I have to deal with.

807
01:03:30,209 --> 01:03:33,461
Contrary to your belief, you are
not the center of my universe.

808
01:03:33,546 --> 01:03:36,589
I have bigger problems than you in
the southwest region to deal with.

809
01:03:36,674 --> 01:03:37,716
Hit him.

810
01:03:38,926 --> 01:03:42,262
Oh, God, are you gonna steal
my kidney and sell it?

811
01:03:42,722 --> 01:03:45,640
Could you please not do anything
awful for five seconds?

812
01:03:46,225 --> 01:03:49,853
- What did she just do to me?
- What did we just do for you?

813
01:03:49,937 --> 01:03:52,355
That's lithium dioxide. It's
gonna take the edge off.

814
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,315
We're trying to get
you back to work.

815
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,484
Give me a couple of boxes of that.
I'll be right as rain.

816
01:03:56,569 --> 01:03:58,486
It's not a cure, it just
abates the symptoms.

817
01:03:58,571 --> 01:04:01,072
Doesn't look like it's
gonna be an easy fix.

818
01:04:01,157 --> 01:04:03,366
Trust me, I know. I'm
good at this stuff.

819
01:04:03,451 --> 01:04:05,827
I've been looking for a suitable
replacement for palladium.

820
01:04:05,911 --> 01:04:10,331
I've tried every combination, every
permutation of every known element.

821
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:13,501
Well, I'm here to tell you,
you haven't tried them all.

822
01:04:14,962 --> 01:04:18,089
Hey, hey, hey. Special delivery.

823
01:04:18,174 --> 01:04:19,716
Candygram.

824
01:04:23,929 --> 01:04:25,388
I brought you something.

825
01:04:25,973 --> 01:04:27,724
Oh, yeah.

826
01:04:30,269 --> 01:04:32,103
We got you the bird, pal.

827
01:04:32,188 --> 01:04:33,521
This is not my bird.

828
01:04:33,939 --> 01:04:36,024
What do you mean? That's the bird.
This is the bird.

829
01:04:36,108 --> 01:04:38,902
Yeah. Pulled a lot of
strings to get this bird.

830
01:04:38,986 --> 01:04:40,278
This is a great bird.

831
01:04:40,362 --> 01:04:42,989
- It's a beautiful bird.
- We got this all the way from Russia.

832
01:04:43,074 --> 01:04:45,533
Hey, man, this not my bird.

833
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:51,790
Well, listen, even if it's not the
bird, I mean, this is a gorgeous bird.

834
01:04:51,874 --> 01:04:54,667
I mean, you know, look, don't
get so attached to things.

835
01:04:54,752 --> 01:04:56,461
Learn to let go.

836
01:04:59,215 --> 01:05:01,716
Wait a minute. Jack,
what is that?

837
01:05:02,259 --> 01:05:05,386
Is that... That's not a helmet.
What is that?

838
01:05:13,896 --> 01:05:17,440
Ivan... What's this? Jack.

839
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,527
Is that a helmet? It doesn't
look like a helmet to me.

840
01:05:20,528 --> 01:05:23,113
How... How are you supposed
to get a head in there?

841
01:05:23,197 --> 01:05:25,038
- Jack, could you put your head in there?
- No.

842
01:05:25,116 --> 01:05:28,326
Try to put your head in there. Go ahead.
Try to put your head in there.

843
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:31,079
See, Ivan? He can't put
his head in there.

844
01:05:31,163 --> 01:05:35,542
That's... That's not a helmet. It's a head.
I need to put a guy in there.

845
01:05:35,626 --> 01:05:39,003
I need to fit a person in that suit.
You understand?

846
01:05:39,338 --> 01:05:41,464
- Drone better.
- What? Drone better?

847
01:05:41,549 --> 01:05:44,134
Why is drone better?
Why is drone better?

848
01:05:44,218 --> 01:05:46,010
People make problem.

849
01:05:46,095 --> 01:05:47,971
Trust me. Drone better.

850
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:52,600
Ivan, you know, I like you.
I got you the bird.

851
01:05:53,477 --> 01:05:55,311
You said, "No problem."

852
01:05:55,396 --> 01:05:58,314
That's what you said to me.
You said, "No problem."

853
01:05:58,399 --> 01:06:01,192
Now I need suits. The
government wants suits.

854
01:06:01,277 --> 01:06:03,278
Like Iron Man. You understand?

855
01:06:03,362 --> 01:06:06,489
That's what the people want. That's
what's gonna make them happy.

856
01:06:07,324 --> 01:06:08,658
Hey, man.

857
01:06:10,202 --> 01:06:12,787
Don't get too
attached to things.

858
01:06:13,497 --> 01:06:15,206
Learn to let go.

859
01:06:18,294 --> 01:06:21,296
These drones better
steal the show, Ivan.

860
01:06:21,922 --> 01:06:25,341
You understand? Better
rock my world, Ivan.

861
01:06:34,935 --> 01:06:36,603
Unbelievable.

862
01:06:37,062 --> 01:06:39,731
This ought to get the
Senate off my ass.

863
01:06:39,815 --> 01:06:43,193
- It's functional?
- Fully mission-capable.

864
01:06:43,569 --> 01:06:46,946
Good. Get Hammer down
here to weaponize it.

865
01:06:47,948 --> 01:06:48,990
Sir?

866
01:06:49,074 --> 01:06:51,701
Justin Hammer's making a weapons
presentation at the Expo.

867
01:06:51,785 --> 01:06:53,411
We'd like this to introduce it.

868
01:06:53,495 --> 01:06:55,079
Sir, I don't believe
that the Expo...

869
01:06:55,164 --> 01:06:57,957
Colonel, the world needs
to see this fast.

870
01:06:58,042 --> 01:07:01,085
- We've got to make this happen.
- Yes, General, but...

871
01:07:01,170 --> 01:07:03,171
It's also an order.

872
01:07:03,547 --> 01:07:04,881
Yes, sir.

873
01:07:05,257 --> 01:07:08,718
Good work, Colonel. You've
made your country proud.

874
01:07:08,802 --> 01:07:10,428
Thank you, sir.

875
01:07:16,602 --> 01:07:20,313
That thing in your chest is
based on unfinished technology.

876
01:07:20,397 --> 01:07:21,439
No, it was finished.

877
01:07:21,523 --> 01:07:25,652
It has never been particularly effective
until I miniaturised it and put it in my...

878
01:07:25,736 --> 01:07:27,862
No. Howard said the arc reactor

879
01:07:27,947 --> 01:07:29,697
was the stepping stone
to something greater.

880
01:07:29,782 --> 01:07:34,285
He was about to kick off an energy race
that was gonna dwarf the arms race.

881
01:07:34,787 --> 01:07:35,912
He was on to something big,

882
01:07:35,996 --> 01:07:39,457
something so big that it was
gonna make the nuclear reactor

883
01:07:39,541 --> 01:07:41,542
look like a triple-A battery.

884
01:07:41,627 --> 01:07:44,128
Just him, or was Anton
Vanko in on this, too?

885
01:07:44,213 --> 01:07:47,298
Anton Vanko is the other
side of that coin.

886
01:07:47,383 --> 01:07:49,425
Anton saw it as a
way to get rich.

887
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:51,886
When your father found
out, he had him deported.

888
01:07:51,971 --> 01:07:53,888
When the Russians found
out he couldn't deliver,

889
01:07:53,973 --> 01:07:55,515
they shipped his
ass off to Siberia

890
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:58,351
and he spent the next 20 years
in a vodka-fuelled rage.

891
01:07:58,435 --> 01:08:00,979
Not quite the environment
you want to raise a kid in,

892
01:08:01,063 --> 01:08:05,191
the son you had the misfortune of
crossing paths with in Monaco.

893
01:08:05,567 --> 01:08:06,901
You told me I hadn't
tried everything.

894
01:08:06,986 --> 01:08:08,079
What do you mean I haven't
tried everything?

895
01:08:08,092 --> 01:08:09,195
What haven't I tried?

896
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:13,533
He said that you were the only
person with the means and knowledge

897
01:08:13,659 --> 01:08:15,660
to finish what he started.

898
01:08:15,744 --> 01:08:17,245
He said that?

899
01:08:17,413 --> 01:08:20,039
Are you that guy? Are you?

900
01:08:20,124 --> 01:08:25,420
'Cause if you are, then you can
solve the riddle of your heart.

901
01:08:29,717 --> 01:08:31,175
I don't know where you
get your information,

902
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:33,511
but he wasn't my biggest fan.

903
01:08:33,595 --> 01:08:34,995
What do you remember
about your dad?

904
01:08:35,055 --> 01:08:36,764
He was cold, he was calculating.

905
01:08:36,849 --> 01:08:39,600
He never told me he loved me. He
never even told me he liked me,

906
01:08:39,685 --> 01:08:41,269
so it's a little tough
for me to digest

907
01:08:41,353 --> 01:08:43,896
when you're telling me he said the
whole future was riding on me

908
01:08:43,897 --> 01:08:46,858
and he's passing it down.
I don't get that.

909
01:08:46,942 --> 01:08:48,192
You're talking about a
guy whose happiest day

910
01:08:48,277 --> 01:08:49,777
was when he shipped me
off to boarding school.

911
01:08:49,862 --> 01:08:50,945
That's not true.

912
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:53,698
Well, then, clearly you knew
my dad better than I did.

913
01:08:54,116 --> 01:08:57,785
As a matter of fact, I did. He was one
of the founding members of S.H.I.E.I.D.

914
01:08:57,870 --> 01:08:59,037
What?

915
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:01,664
- I got a 2: 00.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

916
01:09:01,749 --> 01:09:03,310
- What's this?
- Okay, you're good, right?

917
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:05,126
- No, I'm not good.
- You got this? Right? Right?

918
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:07,086
Got what? I don't even know
what I'm supposed to get.

919
01:09:07,171 --> 01:09:10,423
Natasha will remain a floater
at Stark with her cover intact.

920
01:09:10,507 --> 01:09:13,426
- You remember Agent Coulson, right?
- Yeah.

921
01:09:13,844 --> 01:09:15,345
And Tony,

922
01:09:16,555 --> 01:09:19,599
remember, I got my eye on you.

923
01:09:25,647 --> 01:09:28,900
We've disabled all communications.
No contact with the outside world.

924
01:09:28,984 --> 01:09:30,360
Good luck.

925
01:09:34,448 --> 01:09:35,698
Please.

926
01:09:36,283 --> 01:09:39,494
First thing, I need a little bodywork.
I'll put in a little time at the lab.

927
01:09:39,578 --> 01:09:41,746
If we could send one of your go
on squad down to The Coffee Bean,

928
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:44,415
Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or
something like that, that'd be nice.

929
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:45,625
I'm not here for that.

930
01:09:45,709 --> 01:09:47,189
I've been authorised
by Director Fury

931
01:09:47,252 --> 01:09:49,712
to use any means necessary
to keep you on premises.

932
01:09:49,797 --> 01:09:52,423
If you attempt to leave
or play any games,

933
01:09:52,508 --> 01:09:55,718
I will tase you and watch Supernanny
while you drool into the carpet.

934
01:09:55,803 --> 01:09:58,054
- Okay?
- I think I got it, yeah.

935
01:09:58,138 --> 01:10:00,014
Enjoy your evening's
entertainment.

936
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:28,000
Think this is the power source?

937
01:10:28,085 --> 01:10:32,880
Major, this is not a scientific exercise.
Let's just focus on arming it, all right?

938
01:10:34,007 --> 01:10:35,341
Yes, sir.

939
01:10:35,759 --> 01:10:37,051
Oh, yes!

940
01:10:37,469 --> 01:10:39,387
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

941
01:10:39,471 --> 01:10:41,222
Is it my birthday?

942
01:10:41,515 --> 01:10:44,934
You got it. What did you do?
What did you do?

943
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:50,898
- Is this what I think it is?
- Yes, it is.

944
01:10:50,983 --> 01:10:54,068
Hammer, I want to know what
you're gonna do for us.

945
01:10:54,236 --> 01:10:55,736
What am I going to do for you?

946
01:10:55,821 --> 01:10:58,948
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do for
you is I'm gonna upgrade your software.

947
01:10:58,949 --> 01:11:01,951
- And then, second, I think I should...
- That's not what I'm talking about.

948
01:11:02,035 --> 01:11:04,370
I'm talking about firepower.

949
01:11:05,873 --> 01:11:07,957
Well, you're talking
to the right guy.

950
01:11:09,251 --> 01:11:12,545
Claridge Hi-Tec,
semi-automatic, 9mm pistol.

951
01:11:13,839 --> 01:11:16,174
Too downtown? I agree.

952
01:11:16,717 --> 01:11:18,968
M24 shotgun, pump action.

953
01:11:19,595 --> 01:11:20,887
Five-round magazine.

954
01:11:20,971 --> 01:11:22,388
You know what?
You're not a hunter.

955
01:11:22,389 --> 01:11:24,474
What am I talking about?
I'm getting rid of it.

956
01:11:24,558 --> 01:11:27,018
This is the FN-2000
from Belgium.

957
01:11:27,102 --> 01:11:29,395
They do make something
better than waffles.

958
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:32,356
It's beautiful, but I can tell
this isn't disco enough for you,

959
01:11:32,441 --> 01:11:33,733
so I'm gonna put it right here.

960
01:11:33,817 --> 01:11:36,861
You're looking at a Milkor
40mm grenade launcher.

961
01:11:36,945 --> 01:11:39,989
Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control.

962
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:41,574
You're tough.

963
01:11:41,658 --> 01:11:44,160
Let me tell you something.
Size does matter.

964
01:11:44,244 --> 01:11:45,745
Don't let anyone
tell you different.

965
01:11:46,163 --> 01:11:49,457
This is an M1347.62 Minigun.

966
01:11:49,541 --> 01:11:53,002
Six individual barrels. The
torso taker, powder maker.

967
01:11:53,086 --> 01:11:55,213
Our boys in uniform
call it Uncle Gazpacho,

968
01:11:55,297 --> 01:11:57,673
or Puff the Magic Dragon.

969
01:12:00,677 --> 01:12:01,761
Okay.

970
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:07,475
These are the Cubans, baby. This
is the Cohibas, the Montecristos.

971
01:12:09,144 --> 01:12:11,062
This is a kinetic-kill,
side-winder vehicle

972
01:12:11,146 --> 01:12:15,441
with a secondary
cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX burst.

973
01:12:16,026 --> 01:12:19,529
It's capable of busting the bunker
under the bunker you just busted.

974
01:12:19,613 --> 01:12:21,781
If it were any smarter,
it would write a book.

975
01:12:21,865 --> 01:12:25,284
A book that would make Ulysses look
like it was written in crayon.

976
01:12:25,869 --> 01:12:27,119
It would read it to you.

977
01:12:27,788 --> 01:12:29,288
This is my Eiffel Tower.

978
01:12:29,373 --> 01:12:32,458
This is my Rachmaninoff's Th ird.
My Pietà.

979
01:12:32,542 --> 01:12:35,628
It's completely elegant.
It's bafflingly beautiful.

980
01:12:35,712 --> 01:12:40,424
It's capable of reducing the population
of any standing structure to zero.

981
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:43,427
I call it the Ex-Wife.

982
01:12:48,558 --> 01:12:50,476
That's the best I got.

983
01:12:55,565 --> 01:12:57,233
Are we gonna do this?
Give me something here.

984
01:12:57,317 --> 01:13:01,279
- You're like a sphinx. I can't read you.
- I think I'll take it.

985
01:13:01,571 --> 01:13:04,240
- Which one?
- All of it.

986
01:13:06,201 --> 01:13:07,243
All of it.

987
01:13:44,656 --> 01:13:48,284
Everything is achievable
through technology.

988
01:13:48,535 --> 01:13:50,911
Better living, robust health

989
01:13:50,996 --> 01:13:56,834
and for the first time in human history,
the possibility of world peace.

990
01:13:57,336 --> 01:13:58,586
I'm Howard Stark,

991
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:02,673
and everything you'll need for the
future can be found right here.

992
01:14:02,799 --> 01:14:05,801
City of the Future? City of Tomorrow?
City of...

993
01:14:11,641 --> 01:14:12,767
I'm Howard Stark,

994
01:14:12,851 --> 01:14:16,771
and everything you'll need in the
future can be found right here.

995
01:14:16,855 --> 01:14:19,690
So, from all of us
at Stark industries,

996
01:14:19,816 --> 01:14:22,109
I would like to personally...

997
01:14:22,694 --> 01:14:24,945
Tony, what are you doing back there?
What is that?

998
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:28,657
Put that back. Put it back
where you got it from.

999
01:14:28,867 --> 01:14:31,035
Where's your mother? Maria?

1000
01:14:31,453 --> 01:14:33,371
Go on. Go, go, go, go.

1001
01:14:35,665 --> 01:14:37,875
All right, I think we got...

1002
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:40,044
I'll... I'll...
I'll come in and...

1003
01:14:43,965 --> 01:14:45,883
Are you waiting on me?

1004
01:14:47,677 --> 01:14:52,306
So, from all of us at Stark industries,
I'd like to personally show you

1005
01:14:53,058 --> 01:14:54,141
my ass.

1006
01:14:54,226 --> 01:14:56,310
I'd like to... I can't...
This is...

1007
01:14:56,395 --> 01:14:58,729
I can't... We have
this, don't we?

1008
01:14:58,855 --> 01:15:01,816
This is a ridiculous way...

1009
01:15:02,234 --> 01:15:03,734
Everything

1010
01:15:04,736 --> 01:15:06,237
is achievable

1011
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:08,906
through technology.

1012
01:15:21,378 --> 01:15:22,503
Tony?

1013
01:15:22,587 --> 01:15:24,505
You're too young to
understand this right now,

1014
01:15:24,589 --> 01:15:27,591
so I thought I would put
it on film for you.

1015
01:15:29,428 --> 01:15:31,262
I built this for you.

1016
01:15:32,264 --> 01:15:34,849
And someday you'll realise that
it represents a whole lot more

1017
01:15:34,933 --> 01:15:38,936
than just people's inventions.
It represents my life's work.

1018
01:15:40,105 --> 01:15:42,440
This is the key to the future.

1019
01:15:45,402 --> 01:15:50,197
I'm limited by the technology of my time,
but one day you'll figure this out.

1020
01:15:51,074 --> 01:15:52,783
And when you do,

1021
01:15:53,702 --> 01:15:55,786
you will change the world.

1022
01:15:57,247 --> 01:16:01,208
What is and always will
be my greatest creation

1023
01:16:03,587 --> 01:16:04,962
is you.

1024
01:16:25,942 --> 01:16:28,736
- $6. Six.
- I don't have any dough.

1025
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:30,404
- Here.
- No, sir, that's too much.

1026
01:16:30,489 --> 01:16:31,655
No, it's fine. Take that.

1027
01:16:31,781 --> 01:16:33,782
- It's fine.
- No, señor.

1028
01:16:33,992 --> 01:16:36,994
Take it. Take it. I don't like
people handing me things.

1029
01:16:37,078 --> 01:16:38,996
If you just drop that
there, that'd be great.

1030
01:16:39,331 --> 01:16:41,957
- Are you Iron Man?
- Sometimes.

1031
01:16:42,125 --> 01:16:43,834
We believe in you.

1032
01:16:44,294 --> 01:16:47,004
It was an illegal seizure
of trademark property.

1033
01:16:47,422 --> 01:16:48,506
- Miss Potts?
- Relax.

1034
01:16:48,632 --> 01:16:49,673
- Mr. Stark...
- Is here.

1035
01:16:49,758 --> 01:16:51,592
- He refuses...
- I don't. It's fine.

1036
01:16:51,676 --> 01:16:54,261
- I'll just be a second.
- Listen, it's our position

1037
01:16:54,346 --> 01:16:56,597
that Stark has and
continues to maintain

1038
01:16:56,681 --> 01:16:59,433
proprietary ownership of
the Mark II platform.

1039
01:16:59,518 --> 01:17:02,269
When Mr. Stark announced
he was indeed Iron Man,

1040
01:17:02,354 --> 01:17:04,522
- he was making a promise to America.
- No, the suit belongs to us.

1041
01:17:04,648 --> 01:17:06,524
We trusted that he
would look out for us.

1042
01:17:06,650 --> 01:17:08,817
- Yeah, but you're not... Burt...
- He obviously did not.

1043
01:17:08,818 --> 01:17:11,111
- And now we learn that his secretary...
- Yes, it does.

1044
01:17:11,196 --> 01:17:13,531
A woman named
Virginia "Pepper" Potts,

1045
01:17:13,657 --> 01:17:16,367
has been appointed as CEO
of Stark industries.

1046
01:17:16,451 --> 01:17:17,952
What are her qualifications?

1047
01:17:18,036 --> 01:17:19,119
- No.
- Ms Potts is doing

1048
01:17:19,204 --> 01:17:20,371
nothing to manage
this terrible...

1049
01:17:20,455 --> 01:17:21,956
- Mute.
- No...

1050
01:17:22,791 --> 01:17:24,792
Burt... Burt...
Burt, listen to me.

1051
01:17:24,876 --> 01:17:27,294
Don't tell me that we have the
best patent lawyers in the country

1052
01:17:27,379 --> 01:17:29,505
and then not let me pursue this.

1053
01:17:29,881 --> 01:17:30,965
I'll get this stuff out of here.

1054
01:17:31,049 --> 01:17:33,884
Well, then, tell the
President to sign an order.

1055
01:17:34,678 --> 01:17:36,136
We'll talk about it at the Expo.

1056
01:17:36,221 --> 01:17:39,223
Hammer's giving some
presentation tomorrow evening.

1057
01:17:39,307 --> 01:17:42,184
- Will Tony Stark be there?
- Will I?

1058
01:17:42,811 --> 01:17:45,062
- No, he will not. Bye.
- I would like to be.

1059
01:17:46,356 --> 01:17:47,398
- Got a minute?
- No.

1060
01:17:47,524 --> 01:17:50,234
Come on, you just got off the phone.
You're fine, 30 seconds.

1061
01:17:51,695 --> 01:17:53,988
Twenty-nine. Twenty-eight.

1062
01:17:54,072 --> 01:17:55,739
I was just driving over here,

1063
01:17:55,824 --> 01:17:58,325
and I thought I was coming to
basically apologise, but I'm not.

1064
01:17:58,410 --> 01:18:01,171
- You didn't come here to apologise?
- Look, that goes without saying,

1065
01:18:01,246 --> 01:18:02,830
and I'm working on that.

1066
01:18:02,914 --> 01:18:06,917
But I haven't been
entirely upfront with you,

1067
01:18:07,002 --> 01:18:08,168
and I just want to
try to make good.

1068
01:18:08,253 --> 01:18:10,588
Can I move this? This is crazy.

1069
01:18:10,672 --> 01:18:11,755
It's like a Ferris wheel going.

1070
01:18:11,881 --> 01:18:13,161
- I'm trying to get some...
- No.

1071
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:18,095
Do you know how short life is?

1072
01:18:18,221 --> 01:18:21,265
And if I never got to express...

1073
01:18:21,349 --> 01:18:24,018
And by the way, this is
somewhat revelatory to me.

1074
01:18:24,102 --> 01:18:26,520
And I don't care... I mean, I care.
It would be nice.

1075
01:18:26,605 --> 01:18:28,272
I'm not expecting you to...

1076
01:18:28,356 --> 01:18:29,523
Look, here's what
I'm trying to say.

1077
01:18:29,608 --> 01:18:31,442
- I'm just gonna say it.
- Let me stop you right here, okay?

1078
01:18:31,568 --> 01:18:34,028
Because if you say
"I" one more time,

1079
01:18:34,112 --> 01:18:36,905
I'm gonna actually hurl something
at your head, I think.

1080
01:18:37,449 --> 01:18:39,366
I am trying to run a company.

1081
01:18:39,451 --> 01:18:42,036
- Do you have any idea what that entails?
- Yes.

1082
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:45,122
People are relying on you to be
Iron Man and you've disappeared,

1083
01:18:45,206 --> 01:18:48,542
and all I'm doing is putting out your
fires and taking the heat for it.

1084
01:18:51,129 --> 01:18:54,632
I am trying to do the job
that you were meant to do.

1085
01:18:58,386 --> 01:19:00,721
Did you bring me strawberries?

1086
01:19:01,806 --> 01:19:05,225
Did you know that there's only one
thing on Earth that I'm allergic to?

1087
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:07,603
Allergic to strawberries.

1088
01:19:10,148 --> 01:19:11,148
This is progress, Pepper.

1089
01:19:11,274 --> 01:19:13,984
I knew there was a correlation
between you and this.

1090
01:19:14,903 --> 01:19:16,236
- I need you...
- I need you, too.

1091
01:19:16,237 --> 01:19:18,906
To leave now.
- That's what I'm trying to...

1092
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:25,496
Ms Potts?

1093
01:19:26,122 --> 01:19:29,458
- Hi, come on in.
- Wheels up in 25 minutes.

1094
01:19:30,001 --> 01:19:31,335
Thank you.

1095
01:19:33,129 --> 01:19:34,672
- Anything else, boss?
- I'm good, Hap.

1096
01:19:34,673 --> 01:19:37,800
No, I'll be just...
another minute.

1097
01:19:38,802 --> 01:19:40,427
I lost both the kids
in the divorce.

1098
01:19:44,683 --> 01:19:45,766
No.

1099
01:19:47,936 --> 01:19:53,023
Are you blending in well here, Natalie?
Here at Stark Enterprises?

1100
01:19:54,192 --> 01:19:56,443
Your name is Natalie, isn't it?

1101
01:19:56,528 --> 01:19:59,446
I thought you two
didn't get along.

1102
01:19:59,531 --> 01:20:02,866
- No. That's not so.
- It's just me you don't care for.

1103
01:20:03,034 --> 01:20:05,452
- No? Nothing?
- Actually, while you're here,

1104
01:20:05,537 --> 01:20:08,622
maybe you and Natalie could discuss the
matter of the personal belongings.

1105
01:20:08,707 --> 01:20:10,165
Absolutely.

1106
01:20:16,631 --> 01:20:17,631
I'm surprised you can
keep your mouth shut.

1107
01:20:17,716 --> 01:20:18,799
Boy, you're good.

1108
01:20:18,883 --> 01:20:21,468
You are mind-blowingly duplicitous.
How do you do it?

1109
01:20:21,553 --> 01:20:23,387
You just tear things...
You're a triple impostor.

1110
01:20:23,471 --> 01:20:25,723
I've never seen anything like you.
Is there anything real about you?

1111
01:20:25,849 --> 01:20:26,890
Do you even speak Latin?

1112
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:31,729
Which means? Wait. What?
What did you just say?

1113
01:20:31,813 --> 01:20:35,065
It means you can either drive yourself
home or I can have you collected.

1114
01:20:36,651 --> 01:20:38,068
You're good.

1115
01:21:37,837 --> 01:21:40,506
Jarvis, could you kindly
Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame?

1116
01:21:40,632 --> 01:21:43,133
I need a manipulatable
projection.

1117
01:21:50,433 --> 01:21:53,977
1974 Stark Expo model
scan complete, sir.

1118
01:21:56,189 --> 01:21:58,023
How many buildings are there?

1119
01:21:58,149 --> 01:22:00,567
Am I to include the
Belgian waffle stands?

1120
01:22:00,652 --> 01:22:03,195
That was rhetorical.
Just show me.

1121
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,587
What does that look like to you, Jarvis?
Not unlike an atom.

1122
01:22:20,672 --> 01:22:24,174
In which case the
nucleus would be here.

1123
01:22:25,218 --> 01:22:27,344
Highlight the unisphere.

1124
01:22:36,145 --> 01:22:41,149
- Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.
- What is it you're trying to achieve, sir?

1125
01:22:41,234 --> 01:22:43,068
I'm discovering... Correction.

1126
01:22:43,194 --> 01:22:47,155
I'm rediscovering a new
element, I believe.

1127
01:22:47,907 --> 01:22:50,951
Lose the landscaping, the
shrubbery, the trees.

1128
01:22:51,035 --> 01:22:53,370
Parking lots, exits, entrances.

1129
01:22:58,167 --> 01:23:04,172
Structure the protons and the neutrons
using the pavilions as a framework.

1130
01:23:07,218 --> 01:23:08,385
Dad.

1131
01:23:29,616 --> 01:23:34,411
Dead for almost 20 years, and
still taking me to school.

1132
01:23:40,585 --> 01:23:45,213
The proposed element should serve as
a viable replacement for palladium.

1133
01:23:45,298 --> 01:23:46,381
Thanks, Dad.

1134
01:23:46,466 --> 01:23:49,718
Unfortunately, it is
impossible to synthesise.

1135
01:23:54,265 --> 01:23:57,809
Get ready for a major remodel, fellas.
We're back in hardware mode.

1136
01:24:45,149 --> 01:24:47,442
- I heard you broke the perimeter.
- Yeah.

1137
01:24:48,027 --> 01:24:49,945
That was, like, three years ago.
Where you been?

1138
01:24:50,029 --> 01:24:54,032
- I was doing some stuff.
- Yeah, well, me, too, and it worked.

1139
01:24:54,158 --> 01:24:56,118
Hey, I'm playing for the
home team, Coulson,

1140
01:24:56,202 --> 01:24:58,286
you and all your Fabulous
Furry Freak Brothers.

1141
01:24:58,371 --> 01:25:00,291
Now, are you gonna let me
work or break my balls?

1142
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,501
What's this doing here?

1143
01:25:06,337 --> 01:25:07,379
That's it.

1144
01:25:08,673 --> 01:25:10,799
- Bring that to me.
- You know what this is?

1145
01:25:10,883 --> 01:25:12,563
It's exactly what I
need to make this work.

1146
01:25:14,345 --> 01:25:15,387
Lift the coil.

1147
01:25:15,888 --> 01:25:17,222
Go, go. Put your knees into it.

1148
01:25:17,974 --> 01:25:19,850
There you go. And...

1149
01:25:20,852 --> 01:25:22,811
Drop it. Drop it.

1150
01:25:25,982 --> 01:25:29,067
Perfectly level. I'm busy.
What do you want?

1151
01:25:29,193 --> 01:25:32,362
Nothing. Goodbye.
I've been reassigned.

1152
01:25:32,905 --> 01:25:34,489
Director Fury wants
me in New Mexico.

1153
01:25:34,574 --> 01:25:37,033
- Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.
- So I'm told.

1154
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:39,202
- Secret stuff?
- Something like that.

1155
01:25:40,580 --> 01:25:41,621
- Good luck.
- Bye.

1156
01:25:41,706 --> 01:25:43,790
- Thanks.
- We need you.

1157
01:25:43,875 --> 01:25:46,877
- Yeah, more than you know.
- Not that much.

1158
01:26:05,229 --> 01:26:07,856
Initialising prismatic
accelerator.

1159
01:26:13,905 --> 01:26:16,364
Approaching maximum power.

1160
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:05,080
That was easy.

1161
01:27:21,639 --> 01:27:23,598
Congratulations, sir.

1162
01:27:25,309 --> 01:27:27,811
You have created a new element.

1163
01:27:35,778 --> 01:27:39,573
Sir, the reactor has
accepted the modified core.

1164
01:27:39,657 --> 01:27:42,284
I will begin running
diagnostics.

1165
01:27:48,165 --> 01:27:49,499
Hey, Ivan.

1166
01:27:49,792 --> 01:27:51,418
I got Senator Stern here.

1167
01:27:51,502 --> 01:27:53,962
Thought we'd swing over and look
at some of the drone designs.

1168
01:27:53,963 --> 01:27:56,214
The drone is not
going to be ready.

1169
01:27:56,507 --> 01:27:57,716
Not ready? What do you mean?

1170
01:27:57,842 --> 01:28:01,261
I can make presentation,
not demonstration.

1171
01:28:01,345 --> 01:28:03,346
What the hell is the difference?

1172
01:28:03,472 --> 01:28:06,224
Presentation. No fly. No shoot.

1173
01:28:06,517 --> 01:28:08,351
Well, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

1174
01:28:08,477 --> 01:28:11,563
What can you make them do? I mean,
this is a weapons demonstration.

1175
01:28:11,689 --> 01:28:14,983
- I can make salute.
- You can make salute?

1176
01:28:15,067 --> 01:28:16,443
What do you mean, "make salute"?

1177
01:28:16,527 --> 01:28:20,614
What the hell does that mean, lvan?
This is not what we agreed to, okay?

1178
01:28:20,698 --> 01:28:23,325
You promised me suits and
then you promised me drones.

1179
01:28:23,409 --> 01:28:27,537
- Hey, man, everything will be okay.
- This is not what I wanted.

1180
01:28:39,675 --> 01:28:42,260
Hey, there he is.
It's the bird man.

1181
01:28:43,846 --> 01:28:49,434
Now you like the bird. Is that right?
Is that your bird? I'm confused.

1182
01:28:50,394 --> 01:28:53,772
You said it wasn't, but now it
looks like you're best of pals.

1183
01:28:53,898 --> 01:28:55,825
You love that bird, don't you?
You know what?

1184
01:28:55,838 --> 01:28:57,776
Take the bird.

1185
01:28:59,570 --> 01:29:00,737
Hey!

1186
01:29:02,782 --> 01:29:05,450
Take his pillows, too.
Both of them.

1187
01:29:06,744 --> 01:29:08,662
And his shoes. Take his shoes.

1188
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:14,417
I took your stuff.

1189
01:29:14,502 --> 01:29:17,671
How does that make you feel?
Do you feel bad?

1190
01:29:18,422 --> 01:29:21,091
Good. 'Cause that's how I feel!

1191
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:24,928
We had a contract.

1192
01:29:25,471 --> 01:29:27,305
I saved your life

1193
01:29:28,099 --> 01:29:30,100
and you give me suits.

1194
01:29:30,601 --> 01:29:32,352
That was our deal.

1195
01:29:32,436 --> 01:29:34,479
And you did not deliver.

1196
01:29:35,314 --> 01:29:39,818
I don't know if you're a genius or a fraud.
I don't know what you are.

1197
01:29:42,154 --> 01:29:45,490
Something really, really
great fell into my lap.

1198
01:29:46,117 --> 01:29:49,327
And if it hadn't, I'd be
at your mercy tonight.

1199
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:53,373
Now I have a piece of Stark
tech that I pimped out myself.

1200
01:29:53,624 --> 01:29:55,375
And now your overpriced
paperweights

1201
01:29:55,459 --> 01:29:58,044
are gonna look like a
backdrop to my demonstration.

1202
01:29:58,546 --> 01:30:00,797
Do you dig what I'm
getting at here?

1203
01:30:03,009 --> 01:30:07,303
I don't know if you know this,
but I don't speak Russian!

1204
01:30:10,683 --> 01:30:12,559
I'm gonna leave now.

1205
01:30:12,643 --> 01:30:15,729
I'm gonna go to the Expo.
Maybe I'll even get laid.

1206
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:18,314
You see these guys?
They're your babysitters.

1207
01:30:18,482 --> 01:30:20,984
They are not to be trifled with.

1208
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,236
When I get back, we're
gonna renegotiate

1209
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,655
the terms of our agreement.

1210
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:28,324
And you're gonna make
good on our arrangement

1211
01:30:28,826 --> 01:30:29,951
because if you don't,

1212
01:30:30,036 --> 01:30:32,454
you're gonna be exactly what
you were when I found you,

1213
01:30:32,538 --> 01:30:34,205
a dead man.

1214
01:30:34,331 --> 01:30:35,707
You got that?

1215
01:30:36,667 --> 01:30:39,002
Maybe you can watch me on TV.

1216
01:30:48,429 --> 01:30:50,805
Dummy, you, can we clean up this mess?
You're killing me.

1217
01:30:50,890 --> 01:30:52,330
- You know I don't...
- Incoming call

1218
01:30:52,391 --> 01:30:54,142
with a blocked number, sir.

1219
01:30:54,226 --> 01:30:57,437
My phone privilege is reinstated.
Lovely.

1220
01:30:57,521 --> 01:30:59,064
Coulson. How's the
Land of Enchantment?

1221
01:30:59,065 --> 01:31:01,775
Hey, Tony, how you doing?

1222
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,403
- I double cycle.
- You what?

1223
01:31:06,405 --> 01:31:10,283
You told me double cycle's more power.
Good advice.

1224
01:31:10,618 --> 01:31:12,285
You sound pretty sprightly
for a dead guy.

1225
01:31:12,369 --> 01:31:13,870
You, too.

1226
01:31:16,457 --> 01:31:17,791
- Trace him.
- Sir.

1227
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:21,628
Now, the true history of
Stark name will be written.

1228
01:31:21,712 --> 01:31:22,796
Jarvis, where is he?

1229
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:27,008
Accessing the Oracle grid.
Eastern Seaboard.

1230
01:31:27,093 --> 01:31:31,221
What your father did to
my family over 40 years,

1231
01:31:32,056 --> 01:31:34,724
I will do to you in 40 minutes.

1232
01:31:34,892 --> 01:31:36,810
Sounds good. Let's get
together and hash it out.

1233
01:31:37,103 --> 01:31:38,436
Tri-State area.

1234
01:31:38,562 --> 01:31:40,772
Manhattan and outlying boroughs.

1235
01:31:40,898 --> 01:31:42,774
I hope you're ready.

1236
01:31:45,569 --> 01:31:47,570
Call trace incomplete.

1237
01:31:58,124 --> 01:32:00,750
- Sir...
- You want to run some tests, run them.

1238
01:32:01,752 --> 01:32:03,711
And assemble the suit while you're at it.
Put it together now.

1239
01:32:03,796 --> 01:32:06,636
- We are unclear as to the effects...
- I don't want to hear it, Jarvis.

1240
01:32:10,636 --> 01:32:12,720
That tastes like coconut.

1241
01:32:12,805 --> 01:32:14,514
And metal.

1242
01:32:14,849 --> 01:32:16,432
Oh, wow, yeah!

1243
01:32:29,029 --> 01:32:30,864
I'll keep the car
down here, all right?

1244
01:32:30,948 --> 01:32:32,240
Thank you, Happy.

1245
01:32:32,324 --> 01:32:37,120
Justin Hammer. His presentation will
begin shortly in the main pavilion.

1246
01:32:55,556 --> 01:32:56,806
Yeah.

1247
01:32:57,975 --> 01:33:01,311
That's what I'm talking about.
Thanks for coming.

1248
01:33:01,896 --> 01:33:03,855
Ladies and gentlemen,
for far too long,

1249
01:33:03,981 --> 01:33:08,484
this country has had to place its
brave men and women in harm's way,

1250
01:33:08,652 --> 01:33:10,278
but then the Iron Man arrived,

1251
01:33:10,362 --> 01:33:14,032
and we thought the days of
losing lives were behind us.

1252
01:33:14,867 --> 01:33:17,619
Sadly, that technology
was kept out of reach.

1253
01:33:17,703 --> 01:33:20,038
That's not fair.
That's not right.

1254
01:33:20,122 --> 01:33:22,373
- And it's just too bad.
- Oh, Lord.

1255
01:33:22,458 --> 01:33:24,542
Regardless, it was an
impressive innovation,

1256
01:33:24,627 --> 01:33:27,545
one that grabbed headlines
the world over.

1257
01:33:27,922 --> 01:33:29,547
Well, today, my friends,

1258
01:33:29,632 --> 01:33:33,092
the press is faced with
quite a different problem.

1259
01:33:33,594 --> 01:33:36,095
They are about to
run out of ink.

1260
01:33:41,644 --> 01:33:43,603
Get that out of here.

1261
01:33:44,563 --> 01:33:46,439
Ladies and gentlemen,

1262
01:33:47,483 --> 01:33:49,859
today I present to you

1263
01:33:50,152 --> 01:33:53,321
the new face of the
United States military.

1264
01:33:54,698 --> 01:33:55,990
The Hammer drone.

1265
01:33:58,535 --> 01:33:59,953
Army!

1266
01:34:13,092 --> 01:34:14,259
Navy!

1267
01:34:24,478 --> 01:34:25,937
Air Force!

1268
01:34:33,821 --> 01:34:35,113
Marines!

1269
01:34:47,001 --> 01:34:49,627
Yeah!

1270
01:34:53,298 --> 01:34:56,217
That's a hell of a lot better than
some cheerleaders, let me tell you.

1271
01:34:57,344 --> 01:35:00,221
But as revolutionary
as this technology is,

1272
01:35:00,305 --> 01:35:04,017
there will always be a need for man
to be present in the theatre of war.

1273
01:35:04,601 --> 01:35:07,645
Ladies and gentlemen, today I
am proud to present to you

1274
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:09,480
the very first prototype

1275
01:35:09,565 --> 01:35:12,859
in the Variable Threat
Response Battle Suit

1276
01:35:12,943 --> 01:35:16,779
and its pilot, Air Force
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.

1277
01:35:18,323 --> 01:35:18,823
What?

1278
01:35:41,472 --> 01:35:44,640
For America and its allies, Hammer
Industries is reporting for...

1279
01:36:00,783 --> 01:36:02,450
We got trouble.

1280
01:36:02,534 --> 01:36:04,243
Tony, there are
civilians present.

1281
01:36:04,328 --> 01:36:06,954
I'm here on orders. Let's
not do this right now.

1282
01:36:07,039 --> 01:36:08,331
Give them a wave.

1283
01:36:08,415 --> 01:36:10,583
Hey, all right. Yeah.

1284
01:36:10,667 --> 01:36:12,710
All these people are in danger.
We gotta get them out of here.

1285
01:36:12,795 --> 01:36:14,796
You gotta trust me for
the next five minutes.

1286
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:16,964
Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed
around your house, remember?

1287
01:36:17,049 --> 01:36:19,092
Listen, I think he's
working with Vanko.

1288
01:36:19,176 --> 01:36:20,802
Vanko's alive?

1289
01:36:22,012 --> 01:36:23,179
Yeah.

1290
01:36:23,263 --> 01:36:24,514
Where is he?

1291
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:26,891
- What?
- Where's Vanko?

1292
01:36:27,351 --> 01:36:28,643
- Who?
- Tell me.

1293
01:36:29,269 --> 01:36:31,270
What are you doing here, man?

1294
01:36:31,355 --> 01:36:33,022
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1295
01:36:37,402 --> 01:36:39,821
- Is that you?
- No, I'm not doing that. That's not me.

1296
01:36:40,906 --> 01:36:43,574
I can't move. I'm locked up.
I'm locked up!

1297
01:36:44,368 --> 01:36:46,649
Get out of here. Go! This whole
system's been compromised.

1298
01:36:47,913 --> 01:36:49,831
Let's take it outside.

1299
01:37:01,969 --> 01:37:03,219
No. No!

1300
01:37:13,188 --> 01:37:16,399
- Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.
- Yes, sir.

1301
01:37:18,235 --> 01:37:21,154
Tony, Tony, I'm locked on.
I have target lock.

1302
01:37:21,238 --> 01:37:22,905
- On what?
- On you.

1303
01:37:27,911 --> 01:37:29,745
Tony, on your six!

1304
01:37:47,097 --> 01:37:49,432
- What's going on? What's happening?
- The software's been overridden.

1305
01:37:49,558 --> 01:37:50,766
What? What do you mean
it's been overridden?

1306
01:37:50,851 --> 01:37:52,185
- What does that mean?
- I think he slaved the drones.

1307
01:37:52,269 --> 01:37:53,352
That's impossible.

1308
01:37:53,437 --> 01:37:55,104
- Call the guards.
- All the phones are down, sir.

1309
01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:57,356
Well, then call their...
Call their cells.

1310
01:37:57,441 --> 01:37:58,941
Their cell phones are not
working, either, sir.

1311
01:37:59,067 --> 01:38:00,276
He's locked us out
of the mainframe.

1312
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:01,527
Who's locked you out
of the mainframe?

1313
01:38:01,612 --> 01:38:03,196
Please, please, go away.
Go away.

1314
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:04,614
- I've got this handled.
- Have you now?

1315
01:38:04,698 --> 01:38:05,781
Yes, I do.

1316
01:38:05,908 --> 01:38:08,367
In fact, if your guy hadn't showed
up, this wouldn't be happening.

1317
01:38:08,452 --> 01:38:10,786
So please, now go away.
Thank you.

1318
01:38:11,205 --> 01:38:13,539
Listen, we got to get these
bitches out of here.

1319
01:38:13,749 --> 01:38:15,208
What?

1320
01:38:15,292 --> 01:38:16,626
You tell me who's behind this.

1321
01:38:16,710 --> 01:38:21,255
- Who's behind this?
- Ivan. Ivan Vanko.

1322
01:38:21,632 --> 01:38:24,258
- Where is he?
- He's at my facility.

1323
01:38:27,596 --> 01:38:29,222
- I need NYPD, please.
- No, no, no!

1324
01:38:29,306 --> 01:38:30,598
- Command Central.
- No, no, honey.

1325
01:38:30,599 --> 01:38:32,475
- Don't call the authorities.
- Okay. Right away. Right away.

1326
01:38:32,601 --> 01:38:34,644
Step aside. Step aside.

1327
01:38:35,604 --> 01:38:37,271
Tell me everything you know. Go.

1328
01:38:44,655 --> 01:38:47,657
- How are we doing, Jarvis?
- Remote reboot unsuccessful.

1329
01:39:05,175 --> 01:39:06,676
This way.

1330
01:39:07,344 --> 01:39:09,178
Nobody's answering the phone.
What's going on?

1331
01:39:09,263 --> 01:39:11,514
Get in the car. Take me
to Hammer Industries.

1332
01:39:11,598 --> 01:39:14,016
- I'm not taking you anywhere.
- Fine. You want me to drive?

1333
01:39:14,101 --> 01:39:16,644
No, I'm driving. Get in the car.

1334
01:40:15,078 --> 01:40:16,746
Nice work, kid.

1335
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:21,876
- You got multiples coming in on you.
- Let's get this away from the Expo.

1336
01:40:27,257 --> 01:40:29,675
When we arrive, I need you
to watch the perimeter.

1337
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:33,429
I'm gonna enter the facility
and take down the target.

1338
01:40:35,724 --> 01:40:38,351
- Watch the road.
- I got it. I got it.

1339
01:41:08,757 --> 01:41:09,799
Listen, listen.

1340
01:41:09,925 --> 01:41:11,926
A pack just peeled off. They're
headed back to the Expo.

1341
01:41:12,010 --> 01:41:13,344
Got it.

1342
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:18,599
I'm closing on you.

1343
01:41:18,683 --> 01:41:21,102
Ordnance coming in hot, Tony.
Watch it.

1344
01:41:36,952 --> 01:41:39,620
- Stay in the car.
- I'm not staying in the car.

1345
01:41:39,704 --> 01:41:41,288
I said, stay in the car.

1346
01:41:41,456 --> 01:41:43,457
What are you wearing?

1347
01:41:44,709 --> 01:41:47,002
Look, I'm not letting
you go in there alone.

1348
01:41:47,129 --> 01:41:48,504
You want to help?
Keep the car running.

1349
01:41:48,630 --> 01:41:49,880
Okay.

1350
01:41:53,385 --> 01:41:55,678
Hey, hey, hey. You
can't come in here.

1351
01:41:56,138 --> 01:41:57,680
Hold on. Hey!

1352
01:42:42,392 --> 01:42:44,310
Each set of drones
is communicating

1353
01:42:44,394 --> 01:42:47,146
- in its own unique language.
- Well, choose one and focus on that.

1354
01:42:47,230 --> 01:42:49,231
Have you tried Russian? Why
don't you try Russian?

1355
01:42:52,903 --> 01:42:55,279
Attention. We have
intrusion on Grid W.

1356
01:42:55,363 --> 01:42:57,615
We got it. We're on our way.

1357
01:43:39,074 --> 01:43:40,491
I got him!

1358
01:43:55,340 --> 01:43:57,383
- Rhodey, you still locked on?
- Yeah.

1359
01:43:57,467 --> 01:44:00,970
Drop your socks and grab your Crocs.
We're about to get wet on this ride.

1360
01:44:03,139 --> 01:44:04,265
Wait, wait, wait!

1361
01:44:23,827 --> 01:44:25,286
He's gone.

1362
01:44:29,332 --> 01:44:31,375
I'm sorry, buddy. Had
to thin out the herd.

1363
01:44:32,168 --> 01:44:34,003
What's your 20?

1364
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:48,475
- What are you doing?
- I'm rebooting Rhodey's suit.

1365
01:44:54,858 --> 01:44:55,899
Tony!

1366
01:45:12,417 --> 01:45:14,084
Reboot complete.

1367
01:45:14,753 --> 01:45:16,503
You got your best friend back.

1368
01:45:16,588 --> 01:45:19,965
- Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.
- Well done with the new chest piece.

1369
01:45:20,050 --> 01:45:23,719
I am reading significantly higher output
and your vitals all look promising.

1370
01:45:23,803 --> 01:45:26,555
Yes, for the moment, I'm not dying.
Thank you.

1371
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:28,724
What do you mean you're not dying?
Did you just say you're dying?

1372
01:45:28,808 --> 01:45:30,559
Is that you? No, I'm not.

1373
01:45:30,644 --> 01:45:32,186
- Not any more.
- What's going on?

1374
01:45:32,270 --> 01:45:34,021
I was going to tell you. I
didn't want to alarm you.

1375
01:45:34,105 --> 01:45:35,606
You were gonna tell me?
You really were dying?

1376
01:45:35,732 --> 01:45:37,441
- You didn't let me.
- Why didn't you tell me that?

1377
01:45:37,567 --> 01:45:40,277
I was gonna make you an
omelette and tell you.

1378
01:45:40,403 --> 01:45:43,322
Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon.
You got incoming, Tony.

1379
01:45:43,406 --> 01:45:44,990
Looks like the fight's
coming to you.

1380
01:45:45,075 --> 01:45:46,909
- Great. Pepper?
- Are you okay now?

1381
01:45:46,993 --> 01:45:48,202
I am fine. Don't be mad.

1382
01:45:48,286 --> 01:45:49,953
- I will formally apologise...
- I am mad!

1383
01:45:49,954 --> 01:45:52,915
When I'm not fending
off a Hammeroid attack.

1384
01:45:52,999 --> 01:45:54,439
- Fine.
- We could have been in Venice.

1385
01:45:54,501 --> 01:45:55,542
Oh, please.

1386
01:45:58,922 --> 01:46:00,297
Rhodes?

1387
01:46:00,757 --> 01:46:03,425
Snap out of it, buddy.
I need you.

1388
01:46:04,177 --> 01:46:06,470
They're coming. Come on, let's roll.
Get up.

1389
01:46:09,766 --> 01:46:11,934
Oh, man. You can
have your suit back.

1390
01:46:15,438 --> 01:46:16,772
You okay?

1391
01:46:16,940 --> 01:46:18,482
Yeah, thanks.

1392
01:46:20,026 --> 01:46:22,444
- Tony, look, I'm sorry, okay?
- Don't be.

1393
01:46:22,529 --> 01:46:23,737
No. I should have
trusted you more.

1394
01:46:23,822 --> 01:46:25,406
I'm the one who put you in this position.
Forget it.

1395
01:46:25,490 --> 01:46:27,825
No. It's your fault. I just
wanted to say I'm sorry.

1396
01:46:27,951 --> 01:46:31,203
Thank you. That's all I wanted to hear.
Partner.

1397
01:46:31,454 --> 01:46:35,040
They're coming in hot, any second.
What's the play?

1398
01:46:35,667 --> 01:46:37,292
Well, we want to take
the high ground, okay?

1399
01:46:37,377 --> 01:46:38,961
So let's put the biggest
gun up on that Ridge.

1400
01:46:39,045 --> 01:46:40,337
Got you.

1401
01:46:41,172 --> 01:46:42,256
- Where do you want to be?
- Where are you going?

1402
01:46:42,340 --> 01:46:43,980
- What're you talking about?
- I meant me.

1403
01:46:44,050 --> 01:46:46,051
You have a big gun. You
are not the big gun.

1404
01:46:46,136 --> 01:46:47,511
- Tony, don't be jealous.
- No. It's subtle,

1405
01:46:47,637 --> 01:46:48,762
- all the bells and whistles.
- Yeah.

1406
01:46:48,847 --> 01:46:51,348
- It's called being a badass.
- Fine.

1407
01:46:52,058 --> 01:46:55,436
All right. You go up top.
I'll draw them in.

1408
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:57,396
Don't stay down here. This
is the worst place to be.

1409
01:46:57,480 --> 01:46:58,731
Okay, you got a spot.
Where's mine?

1410
01:46:58,815 --> 01:47:06,815
It's the kill box, Tony. Okay?
This is where you go to die.

1411
01:47:51,534 --> 01:47:53,243
- See that?
- Yeah, yeah, nice.

1412
01:48:01,252 --> 01:48:02,544
Rhodey?

1413
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:05,380
Get down.

1414
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:18,060
Wow. I think you should
lead with that next time.

1415
01:48:18,144 --> 01:48:21,480
Yeah. Sorry, boss. I can only use it once.
It's a one-off.

1416
01:48:23,900 --> 01:48:26,068
I told you that
five minutes ago.

1417
01:48:27,403 --> 01:48:28,779
That's your guy here.

1418
01:48:30,114 --> 01:48:32,115
- Excuse me?
- You're being placed under arrest.

1419
01:48:32,242 --> 01:48:33,659
- Are you kidding me?
- Hands behind your back, sir.

1420
01:48:33,743 --> 01:48:35,410
I'm trying to help here.

1421
01:48:39,499 --> 01:48:43,043
I get it. I see what you're doing.
You're trying to pin this on me, huh?

1422
01:48:43,127 --> 01:48:44,711
That's good. That's good.

1423
01:48:44,796 --> 01:48:47,756
You're starting to think like a
CEO, taking out the competition.

1424
01:48:47,924 --> 01:48:50,300
I like that. You think you're
making a problem for me?

1425
01:48:50,426 --> 01:48:51,468
I'm gonna make a
problem for you.

1426
01:48:51,594 --> 01:48:54,596
I'm gonna be seeing
you again real soon.

1427
01:48:58,768 --> 01:49:00,269
When they get here, I think
you should station them

1428
01:49:00,353 --> 01:49:03,188
at the South, east
and both west exits.

1429
01:49:03,273 --> 01:49:05,357
We shut down the 7 train in and
out of Willets Point already.

1430
01:49:05,441 --> 01:49:08,235
Well, have city buses there to
ferry people to operating lines.

1431
01:49:08,319 --> 01:49:09,820
Yeah. Are you coming with us?

1432
01:49:09,946 --> 01:49:11,665
No, I'm gonna stay
till the park is clear.

1433
01:49:11,678 --> 01:49:13,407
Okay.

1434
01:49:15,159 --> 01:49:17,661
Heads up. You got one
more drone incoming.

1435
01:49:17,787 --> 01:49:19,121
This one looks different.

1436
01:49:19,581 --> 01:49:21,957
The repulsor signature
is significantly higher.

1437
01:49:33,052 --> 01:49:34,720
Good to be back.

1438
01:49:35,305 --> 01:49:36,680
This ain't gonna be good.

1439
01:49:40,226 --> 01:49:42,311
I got something
special for this guy.

1440
01:49:42,478 --> 01:49:44,605
I'm gonna bust his
bunker with the Ex-Wife.

1441
01:49:44,689 --> 01:49:46,148
With the what?

1442
01:49:56,534 --> 01:49:59,036
- Hammer tech?
- Yeah.

1443
01:50:00,872 --> 01:50:02,456
I got this.

1444
01:50:55,385 --> 01:50:57,386
Rhodes. I got an idea.

1445
01:50:57,762 --> 01:51:00,263
- You want to be a hero?
- What?

1446
01:51:00,598 --> 01:51:03,558
I could really use a sidekick.
Put your hand up.

1447
01:51:03,643 --> 01:51:05,519
- This is your idea?
- Yep.

1448
01:51:06,229 --> 01:51:08,814
I'm ready. I'm ready.
Go, go, go!

1449
01:51:12,610 --> 01:51:13,694
Take it.

1450
01:51:42,265 --> 01:51:43,682
You lose.

1451
01:51:51,232 --> 01:51:53,984
All these drones are rigged to blow.
We gotta get out of here, man.

1452
01:51:54,485 --> 01:51:55,736
Pepper?

1453
01:52:35,902 --> 01:52:37,652
Oh, my God! I can't
take this any more.

1454
01:52:37,737 --> 01:52:39,154
- You can't?
- I can't take this.

1455
01:52:39,238 --> 01:52:40,655
- Look at me.
- My body, literally,

1456
01:52:40,740 --> 01:52:41,990
cannot handle the stress.

1457
01:52:42,074 --> 01:52:46,578
I never know if you're gonna kill
yourself or wreck the whole company.

1458
01:52:46,662 --> 01:52:48,663
I think I did okay.

1459
01:52:48,831 --> 01:52:50,874
I quit. I'm resigning.

1460
01:52:51,501 --> 01:52:52,876
That's it.

1461
01:52:53,461 --> 01:52:56,046
What did you just say?
You're done?

1462
01:52:57,340 --> 01:53:00,842
That's surprising. No, it's
not surprising. I get it.

1463
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:04,554
- You don't have to make any excuses.
- I'm... I'm... I'm not making any excuses.

1464
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:05,764
You actually were
just making excuses.

1465
01:53:05,848 --> 01:53:07,349
- But you don't have to.
- No, I wasn't making an excuse.

1466
01:53:07,433 --> 01:53:08,767
- I'm actually very justified.
- Listen. Hey, hey.

1467
01:53:08,851 --> 01:53:11,186
- You deserve better.
- Well...

1468
01:53:11,270 --> 01:53:13,855
You've taken such
good care of me.

1469
01:53:14,732 --> 01:53:17,150
I've been in a tough spot, but
you got me through it, so...

1470
01:53:17,235 --> 01:53:18,485
Right?

1471
01:53:18,569 --> 01:53:19,820
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1472
01:53:20,613 --> 01:53:23,573
- Thank you for understanding.
- Yeah, yeah. Let's talk clean-up.

1473
01:53:23,658 --> 01:53:24,980
I'll handle the transition.
It'll be smooth.

1474
01:53:24,993 --> 01:53:26,326
Okay. What about the press?

1475
01:53:26,410 --> 01:53:28,286
Because you only had the job for a week.
That's gonna seem...

1476
01:53:28,371 --> 01:53:30,163
- Well, with you it's like dog years.
- I know.

1477
01:53:30,164 --> 01:53:31,564
I mean, it's like
the Presidency...

1478
01:53:44,595 --> 01:53:45,846
Weird.

1479
01:53:46,097 --> 01:53:47,617
- No, it's not weird.
- It's okay, right?

1480
01:53:47,682 --> 01:53:49,599
- Yeah.
- Run that by me again.

1481
01:53:49,684 --> 01:53:51,560
I think it was weird.

1482
01:53:51,978 --> 01:53:54,938
You guys look like two seals
fighting over a grape.

1483
01:53:55,481 --> 01:53:57,941
- I had just quit, actually.
- Yeah, so we're not...

1484
01:53:58,025 --> 01:54:00,527
You don't have to do that.
I heard the whole thing.

1485
01:54:00,611 --> 01:54:03,530
- You should get lost.
- I was here first. Get a roof.

1486
01:54:04,448 --> 01:54:06,992
- I thought you were out of one-liners.
- That's the last one.

1487
01:54:07,076 --> 01:54:09,703
- You kicked ass back there, by the way.
- Thank you. You, too.

1488
01:54:09,787 --> 01:54:12,289
Listen, my car got taken
out in the explosion,

1489
01:54:12,373 --> 01:54:15,542
so I'm gonna have to hang on to
your suit for a minute, okay?

1490
01:54:15,626 --> 01:54:17,377
Not okay. Not okay with that.

1491
01:54:17,962 --> 01:54:19,212
It wasn't a question.

1492
01:54:24,802 --> 01:54:28,138
How are you gonna resign
if I don't accept?

1493
01:54:48,618 --> 01:54:50,910
I don't think I want
you looking at that.

1494
01:54:51,078 --> 01:54:53,246
I'm not sure it pertains
to you any more.

1495
01:54:53,331 --> 01:54:58,585
Now this, on the other hand, is
Agent Romanoff's assessment of you.

1496
01:54:59,837 --> 01:55:00,920
Read it.

1497
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:06,843
"Personality overview. Mr. Stark
displays compulsive behaviour."

1498
01:55:06,927 --> 01:55:09,095
In my own defence,
that was last week.

1499
01:55:11,140 --> 01:55:13,975
"Prone to self-destructive
tendencies." I was dying.

1500
01:55:14,101 --> 01:55:16,686
I mean, please. And
aren't we all?

1501
01:55:17,063 --> 01:55:19,898
"Textbook narcissism"?

1502
01:55:21,942 --> 01:55:23,026
Agreed.

1503
01:55:24,111 --> 01:55:25,487
Okay, here it is.

1504
01:55:25,571 --> 01:55:28,907
"Recruitment assessment for Avenger
Initiative. Iron Man? Yes."

1505
01:55:28,991 --> 01:55:31,534
- I gotta think about it.
- Read on.

1506
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:35,622
"Tony Stark not...

1507
01:55:35,706 --> 01:55:37,248
"Not recommended"?

1508
01:55:38,459 --> 01:55:39,668
That doesn't make any sense.

1509
01:55:39,752 --> 01:55:42,671
How can you approve me
but not approve me?

1510
01:55:43,339 --> 01:55:44,756
I got a new ticker.

1511
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:47,842
I'm trying to do
right by Pepper.

1512
01:55:48,427 --> 01:55:51,346
I'm in a stable-ish
relationship.

1513
01:55:52,181 --> 01:55:54,057
Which leads us to believe
at this juncture

1514
01:55:54,141 --> 01:55:57,310
we'd only like to use
you as a consultant.

1515
01:56:04,235 --> 01:56:06,111
You can't afford me.

1516
01:56:08,447 --> 01:56:10,699
Then again, I will waive
my customary retainer

1517
01:56:10,783 --> 01:56:13,660
in exchange for a small favour.

1518
01:56:14,620 --> 01:56:19,541
Rhodey and I are being honoured in
Washington and we need a presenter.

1519
01:56:21,377 --> 01:56:22,877
I'll see what I can do.

1520
01:56:24,588 --> 01:56:29,426
It is my honour to be here today to
present these distinguished awards

1521
01:56:29,510 --> 01:56:33,513
to Lieutenant Colonel James
Rhodes and Mr. Tony Stark,

1522
01:56:33,597 --> 01:56:36,933
who is, of course, a
national treasure.

1523
01:56:39,103 --> 01:56:40,437
Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel,

1524
01:56:40,521 --> 01:56:42,897
for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

1525
01:56:43,190 --> 01:56:45,191
- You deserve this.
- Thank you, sir.

1526
01:56:46,902 --> 01:56:48,194
Mr. Stark.

1527
01:56:48,279 --> 01:56:52,365
Thank you for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

1528
01:56:52,450 --> 01:56:54,117
You deserve this.

1529
01:56:55,578 --> 01:56:58,037
Oh, sorry.

1530
01:56:58,122 --> 01:57:01,541
Funny how annoying a little
prick can be, isn't it?

1531
01:57:03,002 --> 01:57:04,794
Let's get a photo.

1532
02:04:30,949 --> 02:04:32,909
Sir, we've found it.
