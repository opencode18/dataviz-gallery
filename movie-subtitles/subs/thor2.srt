0
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,628
Long before the birth of
light, there was darkness.

1
00:00:38,795 --> 00:00:42,840
And from that darkness
came the Dark Elves.

2
00:00:44,717 --> 00:00:48,429
Millennia ago, the most ruthless
of their kind, Malekith

3
00:00:48,596 --> 00:00:53,434
sought to transform our universe
back into one of eternal night.

4
00:00:55,895 --> 00:01:00,608
Such evil was possible through
the power of the Aether,

5
00:01:00,817 --> 00:01:04,487
an ancient force of
infinite destruction.

6
00:01:07,657 --> 00:01:08,783
Malekith.

7
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,660
Asgard's forces are upon us.

8
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:23,381
The noble armies of Asgard,
led by my father, King Bor,

9
00:01:23,506 --> 00:01:26,425
waged a mighty war
against these creatures.

10
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:39,689
Send in the Cursed!

11
00:01:56,497 --> 00:01:59,350
As the Nine Worlds
converged above him,

12
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:03,838
Malekith could at last
unleash the Aether.

13
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,145
Ahh!

14
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:25,234
But Asgard ripped the
weapon from his grasp.

15
00:02:26,277 --> 00:02:28,446
Without it, the Dark Elves fell.

16
00:02:43,336 --> 00:02:44,921
With the battle all but lost,

17
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:47,590
Malekith sacrificed
his own people

18
00:02:48,424 --> 00:02:52,470
in a desperate attempt to
lay waste to Asgard's army.

19
00:02:55,306 --> 00:02:57,642
Their deaths will
mean our survival.

20
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:01,103
This war is far from over.

21
00:03:08,736 --> 00:03:14,325
Malekith was vanquished, and
the Aether was no more.

22
00:03:15,368 --> 00:03:17,245
Or so we were led to believe.

23
00:03:18,704 --> 00:03:22,041
Sire, the Aether.
Shall we destroy it?

24
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,086
If only we could.

25
00:03:25,253 --> 00:03:27,088
But its power is too great.

26
00:03:27,797 --> 00:03:30,174
Bury it deep.

27
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:32,718
Somewhere no one
will ever find it.

28
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,553
Loki.

29
00:04:16,053 --> 00:04:17,263
Hello, Mother.

30
00:04:18,097 --> 00:04:19,640
Have I made you proud?

31
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:22,184
Please, don't make this worse.

32
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:24,103
Define "worse."

33
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,855
Enough!

34
00:04:26,022 --> 00:04:28,316
I will speak to the
prisoner alone.

35
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:44,707
I really don't see what
all the fuss is about.

36
00:04:44,874 --> 00:04:48,252
Do you not truly feel the
gravity of your crimes?

37
00:04:48,377 --> 00:04:51,213
Wherever you go,
there is war, ruin,

38
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:53,382
and death.

39
00:04:53,549 --> 00:04:57,762
I went down to Midgard to rule the
people of Earth as a benevolent God.

40
00:04:58,637 --> 00:05:00,097
Just like you.

41
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:04,060
We are not gods. We are
born, we live, we die.

42
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:06,604
Just as humans do.

43
00:05:07,563 --> 00:05:09,940
Give or take 5,000 years.

44
00:05:10,107 --> 00:05:13,861
All this because Loki
desires a throne.

45
00:05:14,028 --> 00:05:15,363
It is my birthright.

46
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:18,866
Your birthright was to die

47
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:20,910
as a child.

48
00:05:22,036 --> 00:05:24,497
Cast out onto a frozen rock.

49
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:28,626
If I had not taken you in,

50
00:05:28,793 --> 00:05:31,420
you would not be
here now to hate me.

51
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:33,773
If I am for the axe,
then for mercy's sake,

52
00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:36,300
just swing it.

53
00:05:36,842 --> 00:05:38,652
It's not that I don't
love our little talks,

54
00:05:38,677 --> 00:05:40,596
it's just...

55
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,349
I don't love them.

56
00:05:43,516 --> 00:05:45,743
Frigga is the only reason
you're still alive,

57
00:05:45,768 --> 00:05:47,186
and you will never
see her again.

58
00:05:48,104 --> 00:05:52,400
You will spend the rest of
your days in the dungeons.

59
00:05:55,528 --> 00:05:57,655
And what of Thor?

60
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,867
You'll make that witless oaf
king while I rot in chains.

61
00:06:02,034 --> 00:06:05,538
Thor must strive to undo
the damage you have done.

62
00:06:05,704 --> 00:06:07,224
He will bring order
to the Nine Realms

63
00:06:07,373 --> 00:06:09,333
and then, yes...

64
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:12,169
He will be king.

65
00:06:21,887 --> 00:06:23,013
- Ah!

66
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,260
I've got this completely
under control!

67
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:03,471
Is that why everything
is on fire?

68
00:07:18,444 --> 00:07:19,445
Ah!

69
00:07:27,495 --> 00:07:29,038
You're welcome.

70
00:07:31,707 --> 00:07:32,708
Ha!

71
00:07:50,726 --> 00:07:51,769
All yours.

72
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,376
Hello.

73
00:08:18,754 --> 00:08:20,297
I accept your surrender.

74
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:34,520
Anyone else?

75
00:08:42,403 --> 00:08:45,948
Perhaps next time we should
start with the big one.

76
00:08:46,991 --> 00:08:49,159
Keep moving. Come on!

77
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:03,090
Keep moving. Go ahead of me.
Don't you turn around!

78
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,884
Where do we go next?

79
00:09:06,051 --> 00:09:10,014
Hogan, the peace is nearly
won across the Nine Realms.

80
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,684
You should stay here. Be with
your people, where your heart is.

81
00:09:13,851 --> 00:09:15,436
Asgard can wait.

82
00:09:16,854 --> 00:09:18,814
You have my thanks.

83
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:21,650
As you have mine.

84
00:09:25,863 --> 00:09:27,448
Heimdall, when you're ready.

85
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:14,370
Is Vanaheim secure?

86
00:10:14,536 --> 00:10:15,996
As are Nornheim and Ria.

87
00:10:16,246 --> 00:10:18,846
Though our work would have gone
more quickly with you at the fore.

88
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:23,879
You must think I'm a piece of bread
that needs to be buttered so heavily.

89
00:10:24,254 --> 00:10:26,131
That was not my intent.

90
00:10:26,423 --> 00:10:28,692
For the first time since
Bifrost was destroyed,

91
00:10:28,717 --> 00:10:30,511
the Nine Realms are at peace.

92
00:10:30,678 --> 00:10:33,097
They're well reminded
of our strength

93
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:37,951
and you have earned their
respect and my gratitude.

94
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:39,103
Thank you.

95
00:10:39,978 --> 00:10:41,730
Nothing out of order

96
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,025
except your confused
and distracted heart.

97
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:47,444
This isn't about
Jane Foster, Father.

98
00:10:47,861 --> 00:10:49,501
Human lives are fleeting,
they're nothing.

99
00:10:49,655 --> 00:10:51,695
You'd be better served by
what lies in front of you.

100
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,095
I'm telling you this,
not as the Allfather,

101
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,221
but as your father.

102
00:10:57,246 --> 00:10:58,247
You are ready.

103
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,374
The time has come for
you to take the throne.

104
00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:02,251
Embrace and celebrate
what you've won.

105
00:11:02,835 --> 00:11:04,436
Join your warriors.

106
00:11:04,461 --> 00:11:06,922
Eat and drink, revel
in their celebration.

107
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:10,384
At least pretend
to enjoy yourself.

108
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,555
Another!

109
00:12:12,863 --> 00:12:15,866
There was a time when you
would celebrate for weeks.

110
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:20,287
I remember you celebrated
the Battle of Harokin

111
00:12:20,412 --> 00:12:22,664
so much that you nearly
started the second.

112
00:12:23,332 --> 00:12:25,334
Well, the first was so much fun.

113
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,842
Take a drink with me.

114
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:37,012
Surely, the Allfather could have
no further task for you tonight.

115
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:39,014
No, this is one I set myself.

116
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:44,061
It does not go unnoticed that
you disappear each night.

117
00:12:44,436 --> 00:12:46,438
There are nine realms.

118
00:12:46,605 --> 00:12:49,566
The future king of Asgard
must focus on more than one.

119
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,465
I thank you for your sword

120
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,618
and for your counsel good Lady.

121
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:21,098
Hi.

122
00:13:21,932 --> 00:13:23,433
Hi.

123
00:13:23,725 --> 00:13:24,925
So, what's the story with you?

124
00:13:25,602 --> 00:13:27,704
Why does there have to be a
story? There's no story.

125
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:30,040
You spent the first ten
minutes of our date

126
00:13:30,065 --> 00:13:32,025
hiding behind a menu that
has three choices on it.

127
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:34,528
It's either chicken,
vegetarian, or fish, Jane.

128
00:13:34,903 --> 00:13:36,738
I think there's a story

129
00:13:36,905 --> 00:13:40,075
and I'm thinking the
story involves a guy.

130
00:13:40,742 --> 00:13:42,077
It's complicated.

131
00:13:42,244 --> 00:13:43,412
Is he still around?

132
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,539
No, he...

133
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,207
Went away.

134
00:13:47,374 --> 00:13:48,750
I've been there.

135
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:50,961
The going away. It's
hard, isn't it?

136
00:13:51,253 --> 00:13:52,462
I was seeing a woman

137
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:54,423
and she took a job in New York.

138
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,884
Eventually, the
distance killed it.

139
00:13:57,092 --> 00:14:00,429
And the fact that she kept
sleeping with other dudes.

140
00:14:00,596 --> 00:14:02,180
- No!
- Oh, so many.

141
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:06,351
Hi. Could we get
some wine, please?

142
00:14:06,518 --> 00:14:07,561
Sure, I'd love some.

143
00:14:07,686 --> 00:14:09,271
Richard, this is Darcy.

144
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:11,773
What are you doing here?

145
00:14:13,984 --> 00:14:14,985
Oh. Hello.

146
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:18,822
So, I show up to work at
the lab your mom's house,

147
00:14:18,947 --> 00:14:22,659
fully expecting you to be
moping around in your pajamas,

148
00:14:22,784 --> 00:14:24,494
eating ice cream and
obsessing about...

149
00:14:24,661 --> 00:14:25,662
You know who.

150
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:26,872
Ah.

151
00:14:26,997 --> 00:14:29,416
But you're not. You're
wearing lady clothes.

152
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,126
You even showered, didn't you?
You smell good.

153
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:32,311
Is there a point to all this?

154
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:34,438
Because there really needs
to be a point to all this.

155
00:14:34,463 --> 00:14:35,672
Right.

156
00:14:36,214 --> 00:14:38,774
You know all that scientific
equipment you don't look at anymore?

157
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:41,261
You might want to start
looking at it again.

158
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:43,430
This is the reason we came
all the way out here.

159
00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:44,615
It's malfunctioning.

160
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,641
That's what I said.

161
00:14:47,184 --> 00:14:48,660
That's what I did.

162
00:14:48,685 --> 00:14:50,646
I thought you would do something
a little more scientific.

163
00:14:50,812 --> 00:14:52,414
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- Yeah, it's...

164
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:53,607
it doesn't look like nothing.

165
00:14:53,732 --> 00:14:56,252
It kind of looks like the readings
that Erik was rambling about.

166
00:14:56,276 --> 00:14:57,361
Our friend Erik

167
00:14:57,986 --> 00:14:59,488
kind of went banana balls.

168
00:14:59,613 --> 00:15:00,631
He's not interested.

169
00:15:00,656 --> 00:15:01,657
- I'm not interested.
- I'm interested.

170
00:15:01,907 --> 00:15:03,325
It's time for you to go now.

171
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:05,786
Okay.

172
00:15:08,997 --> 00:15:10,223
Short but sweet.

173
00:15:10,248 --> 00:15:11,959
She needs help.

174
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:17,172
I think I'm going to
have the sea bass.

175
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:19,216
Sea bass, yeah.
Sea bass is good.

176
00:15:20,258 --> 00:15:24,680
Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass,
sea bass, sea bass, sea bass.

177
00:15:24,846 --> 00:15:27,307
Sea bass...

178
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,660
Sea bass.

179
00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:31,161
Jane?

180
00:15:31,186 --> 00:15:32,829
Maybe you should stop
saying "sea bass"

181
00:15:32,854 --> 00:15:33,897
and go after your friend.

182
00:15:34,898 --> 00:15:36,024
This was so fun.

183
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:38,944
I'll just stay here and
say "sea bass" alone.

184
00:15:46,827 --> 00:15:47,828
And I hate you.

185
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,580
What? I said he was cute.

186
00:15:50,914 --> 00:15:52,708
Just shut up and drive.

187
00:16:01,842 --> 00:16:03,163
- You need to take
the next left.

188
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:06,054
- Who's he?
- He's my intern.

189
00:16:06,596 --> 00:16:08,390
- You have an intern?
- Oh, yeah.

190
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,517
Hello, Dr. Foster.

191
00:16:10,642 --> 00:16:12,483
It's such a great honor
to be working with you.

192
00:16:12,728 --> 00:16:14,855
Right. I have to call Erik.

193
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,314
Oh, take a right.

194
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:19,651
And a left.

195
00:16:21,737 --> 00:16:24,698
I have totally mastered
driving in London.

196
00:16:24,823 --> 00:16:28,326
Hi, Erik. It's me again.
Where are you?

197
00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:31,372
I came here because you said you were
onto something, and then you vanish.

198
00:16:31,496 --> 00:16:32,914
I'm here at Stonehenge

199
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:36,251
for what has been an interesting
unfolding of events today.

200
00:16:36,585 --> 00:16:38,145
The police were
called to the scene

201
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,730
shortly after 11 A.M.
this morning

202
00:16:39,755 --> 00:16:43,233
after a seemingly harmless
rambler approached the area

203
00:16:43,258 --> 00:16:46,053
then, decided to strip
naked and effectively

204
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:48,305
terrorize tourists there
with scientific equipment

205
00:16:48,597 --> 00:16:51,308
whilst shouting that he
was trying to save them.

206
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,746
The man, later identified as noted
astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig

207
00:16:55,771 --> 00:16:58,398
has been called in for
questioning by police.

208
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,444
Come on, this is exciting.

209
00:17:03,111 --> 00:17:04,738
Look! The intern is excited.

210
00:17:04,946 --> 00:17:06,073
"Ian."

211
00:17:06,198 --> 00:17:07,716
Do you want the phase meter?

212
00:17:07,741 --> 00:17:09,201
- No.
- Bring the phase meter.

213
00:17:10,118 --> 00:17:11,161
The toaster-looking thing.

214
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:13,872
Yeah. I know what
the phase meter is.

215
00:17:21,546 --> 00:17:23,982
How do I change the
ring-tone on this thing?

216
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:26,026
An astrophysicist
with three degrees

217
00:17:26,051 --> 00:17:27,803
should be able to change
her own ring-tone.

218
00:17:27,928 --> 00:17:29,446
Why are you calling me?

219
00:17:29,471 --> 00:17:31,782
I didn't want to shout.
Intern says it's this way.

220
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:33,850
- "Ian." My name is Ian.
- Shh.

221
00:17:47,364 --> 00:17:51,034
I am not getting stabbed
in the name of science.

222
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:52,719
It's okay, we're Americans.

223
00:17:52,744 --> 00:17:54,763
Is that supposed to
make them like us?

224
00:17:54,788 --> 00:17:56,540
- They'll make it go away.
- Shh.

225
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,460
Oh, they're kids.

226
00:18:00,794 --> 00:18:01,920
Are you the police?

227
00:18:02,546 --> 00:18:05,257
No, we're scientists.
Well, I am.

228
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:06,633
Thanks.

229
00:18:06,758 --> 00:18:08,426
We just found it.

230
00:18:10,637 --> 00:18:11,847
Can you show us?

231
00:18:38,331 --> 00:18:40,834
That doesn't seem right.

232
00:18:57,726 --> 00:18:58,894
Where'd it go?

233
00:19:12,449 --> 00:19:13,450
That's...

234
00:19:14,034 --> 00:19:15,118
That's incredible!

235
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,258
What happened?

236
00:19:30,425 --> 00:19:31,801
Sometimes they come back.

237
00:19:32,093 --> 00:19:33,511
Sometimes they don't.

238
00:19:36,264 --> 00:19:37,682
I want to throw something!

239
00:19:37,807 --> 00:19:38,934
Jane, give me your shoe.

240
00:19:41,436 --> 00:19:43,730
I haven't seen readings
like this since...

241
00:19:44,356 --> 00:19:46,483
Since... New Mexico?

242
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:52,948
Don't touch anything!

243
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,285
Give me your shoe.

244
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,125
Oh.

245
00:20:18,348 --> 00:20:20,809
Were those the car keys?

246
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,672
Whoa. Ah!

247
00:20:52,674 --> 00:20:54,175
Oh!

248
00:20:58,513 --> 00:20:59,514
Darcy!

249
00:21:46,728 --> 00:21:47,729
Oh!

250
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:02,804
The Aether awakens us.

251
00:23:02,971 --> 00:23:06,433
The Convergence returns.

252
00:23:21,156 --> 00:23:22,824
You're late.

253
00:23:23,908 --> 00:23:27,162
Merriment can sometimes be a
heavier burden than battle.

254
00:23:27,328 --> 00:23:28,968
Then you're doing one
of them incorrectly.

255
00:23:29,747 --> 00:23:31,666
Perhaps.

256
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,668
How fare the stars?

257
00:23:33,835 --> 00:23:35,503
Heimdall Still shining.

258
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,465
From here, I can see nine
realms and ten trillion souls.

259
00:23:43,344 --> 00:23:46,097
Do you recall what I taught
you of the Convergence?

260
00:23:46,264 --> 00:23:47,348
Yes.

261
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,851
The alignment of the worlds.

262
00:23:50,018 --> 00:23:51,728
It approaches, doesn't it?

263
00:23:51,978 --> 00:23:55,857
The universe hasn't seen this
marvel since before my watch began.

264
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,111
Few can sense it. Even
fewer can see it.

265
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:04,073
But while its effects
can be dangerous,

266
00:24:04,908 --> 00:24:07,744
it is truly beautiful.

267
00:24:09,037 --> 00:24:10,555
I see nothing.

268
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,209
Or, perhaps, that is not
the beauty you seek.

269
00:24:20,048 --> 00:24:21,382
How is she?

270
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:23,468
She's quite clever,
your mortal.

271
00:24:23,593 --> 00:24:24,903
She doesn't know it yet,

272
00:24:24,928 --> 00:24:27,430
but she studies the
Convergence as well.

273
00:24:27,597 --> 00:24:28,806
Even.

274
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:31,976
What?

275
00:24:34,812 --> 00:24:36,231
I can't see her.

276
00:25:15,645 --> 00:25:18,231
Jane!

277
00:25:18,815 --> 00:25:20,108
Where the hell were you?

278
00:25:20,441 --> 00:25:21,918
Tell me you didn't
call the police.

279
00:25:21,943 --> 00:25:23,069
What was I supposed to do?

280
00:25:23,194 --> 00:25:25,046
- Not call the police.
- I was freaking out.

281
00:25:25,071 --> 00:25:26,339
You call the cops,
they call the Feds.

282
00:25:26,364 --> 00:25:28,283
Next thing you know, we have
S.H.I.E.L.D. crawling all over.

283
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:30,009
- "Area 51-ing" the place.
- Jane.

284
00:25:30,034 --> 00:25:32,178
We had a stable
gravitation anomaly.

285
00:25:32,203 --> 00:25:33,496
We had unimpeded access.

286
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,124
Our only competition
was ten years old!

287
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:37,834
Jane! You were gone
for five hours.

288
00:25:38,376 --> 00:25:39,627
What?

289
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:48,136
That's weird.

290
00:26:09,699 --> 00:26:11,117
Typical.

291
00:26:11,868 --> 00:26:12,910
Jane.

292
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,333
Sorry. I just needed to
make sure you were real.

293
00:26:18,499 --> 00:26:20,001
It's been a very strange day.

294
00:26:20,168 --> 00:26:21,669
I am. Jane, what...

295
00:26:22,086 --> 00:26:23,129
Where were you?

296
00:26:23,338 --> 00:26:24,339
Where were you?

297
00:26:25,256 --> 00:26:26,591
Heimdall cannot see you.

298
00:26:26,758 --> 00:26:28,509
I was right here
where you left me.

299
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,845
I was waiting, and
then I was crying

300
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,513
and then I went out
looking for you.

301
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,223
You said you were coming back.

302
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,726
I know. I know, but the
Bifrost was destroyed.

303
00:26:36,893 --> 00:26:38,436
The Nine Realms
erupted into chaos.

304
00:26:38,561 --> 00:26:40,730
Wars were raging,
marauders were pillaging.

305
00:26:41,272 --> 00:26:42,899
I had to put an end
to the slaughter.

306
00:26:44,484 --> 00:26:48,296
As excuses go,
it's not terrible.

307
00:26:48,321 --> 00:26:51,157
But I saw you on TV.
You were in New York!

308
00:26:52,075 --> 00:26:54,844
Jane, I fought to protect you
from the dangers of my world

309
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:56,663
but I was wrong.

310
00:26:56,829 --> 00:26:58,706
I was a fool.

311
00:26:59,582 --> 00:27:03,044
But I believe that fate
brought us together.

312
00:27:05,129 --> 00:27:08,174
Jane, I don't know where you were, or
what happened, but I do know this...

313
00:27:09,008 --> 00:27:10,009
What?

314
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,303
I know...

315
00:27:13,513 --> 00:27:14,639
You do?

316
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,225
Do what?

317
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:18,976
What?

318
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,561
Hey!

319
00:27:22,313 --> 00:27:23,773
Is this you?

320
00:27:28,002 --> 00:27:29,962
Uh, we're kind of in the
middle of something here.

321
00:27:29,987 --> 00:27:32,657
Um, I'm pretty sure we
are getting arrested.

322
00:27:32,907 --> 00:27:33,908
Hold that thought.

323
00:27:35,326 --> 00:27:38,971
Look at you, still all
muscly and everything.

324
00:27:38,996 --> 00:27:40,723
How's space?

325
00:27:40,748 --> 00:27:42,875
Space is fine.

326
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,252
Excuse me.

327
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:45,561
- Are you Jane Foster?
- Yes.

328
00:27:45,586 --> 00:27:46,587
Do you know this man?

329
00:27:48,131 --> 00:27:49,257
He's my intern.

330
00:27:50,425 --> 00:27:51,592
My intern's intern.

331
00:27:51,718 --> 00:27:53,778
This is private property and you're
trespassing, the lot of you.

332
00:27:53,803 --> 00:27:55,096
You'll have to come with me.

333
00:28:00,893 --> 00:28:01,894
Jane.

334
00:28:02,687 --> 00:28:04,647
- Jane.
- Thor?

335
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:05,982
Are you all right?

336
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,358
What just happened?

337
00:28:07,942 --> 00:28:10,503
Place your hands on your heads.
Step back.

338
00:28:10,528 --> 00:28:11,629
This woman is unwell.

339
00:28:11,654 --> 00:28:12,655
She's dangerous.

340
00:28:13,656 --> 00:28:14,991
So am I.

341
00:28:15,992 --> 00:28:18,119
Requesting armed response
officers to scene.

342
00:28:18,494 --> 00:28:20,121
- Hold on to me.
- What are you doing?

343
00:28:28,463 --> 00:28:30,506
Holy shit.

344
00:28:57,992 --> 00:29:00,036
We have to do that again.

345
00:29:00,495 --> 00:29:01,496
Hi.

346
00:29:04,332 --> 00:29:06,501
Welcome to Asgard.

347
00:29:27,939 --> 00:29:30,525
Look upon my legacy, Algrim.

348
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,737
I can barely remember a
time before the light.

349
00:29:35,488 --> 00:29:38,658
Our survival will
be your legacy.

350
00:29:40,618 --> 00:29:44,347
The Asgardians will suffer
as we have suffered.

351
00:29:44,372 --> 00:29:45,681
I will reclaim the Aether.

352
00:29:45,706 --> 00:29:47,016
I will restore our world.

353
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:49,752
And I will put an end to
this poisoned universe.

354
00:29:58,052 --> 00:29:59,111
What's that?

355
00:29:59,136 --> 00:30:00,179
Be still.

356
00:30:07,728 --> 00:30:10,106
This is not of Earth.
What is it?

357
00:30:10,898 --> 00:30:12,567
We do not know.

358
00:30:13,276 --> 00:30:17,238
But she will not survive the amount
of energy surging within her.

359
00:30:22,785 --> 00:30:24,465
That's a quantum field
generator, isn't it?

360
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:26,914
It's a soul forge.

361
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,251
Does a soul forge transfer molecular
energy from one place to another?

362
00:30:33,129 --> 00:30:34,171
Yes.

363
00:30:34,297 --> 00:30:36,048
Quantum field generator.

364
00:30:37,174 --> 00:30:40,094
My words are mere noises to you
that you ignore them completely?

365
00:30:40,261 --> 00:30:41,387
She is ill.

366
00:30:41,512 --> 00:30:43,764
She is mortal.

367
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:45,474
Illness is their defining trait.

368
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,285
I brought her here
because we can help her.

369
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,228
She does not belong
here in Asgard

370
00:30:49,395 --> 00:30:52,773
any more than a goat belongs
at a banquet table.

371
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:56,252
Did he just... Who do
you think you are?

372
00:30:56,277 --> 00:30:58,821
I am Odin, King of Asgard.

373
00:30:58,988 --> 00:31:00,531
Protector of the Nine Realms.

374
00:31:01,407 --> 00:31:03,284
Oh. Well, I'm...

375
00:31:03,451 --> 00:31:06,287
I know very well who
you are, Jane Foster.

376
00:31:07,246 --> 00:31:08,623
You told your dad about me?

377
00:31:09,498 --> 00:31:10,958
Something is within her, Father.

378
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:12,404
Something I have
not seen before.

379
00:31:12,418 --> 00:31:13,628
Her world has its healers.

380
00:31:13,753 --> 00:31:15,673
They are called "doctors."
Let them deal with it.

381
00:31:15,796 --> 00:31:17,590
Guards, take her
back to Midgard.

382
00:31:18,966 --> 00:31:20,468
No, I would not...

383
00:31:22,303 --> 00:31:23,387
touch her.

384
00:31:23,512 --> 00:31:24,805
Jane, are you all right?

385
00:31:25,348 --> 00:31:26,474
Yeah.

386
00:31:30,186 --> 00:31:31,437
It's impossible.

387
00:31:32,647 --> 00:31:35,399
The infection...
It's defending her.

388
00:31:36,025 --> 00:31:37,318
No.

389
00:31:37,818 --> 00:31:39,487
It's defending itself.

390
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:42,531
Come with me.

391
00:31:42,657 --> 00:31:46,452
There are relics that
pre-date the universe itself.

392
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:50,498
What lies within her
appears to be one of them.

393
00:31:51,499 --> 00:31:54,001
The Nine Realms are not eternal.

394
00:31:54,168 --> 00:31:56,671
They had a dawn as
they will have a dusk.

395
00:31:58,005 --> 00:31:59,006
But before that dawn

396
00:31:59,173 --> 00:32:05,513
the dark forces, the Dark Elves,
reigned absolute and unchallenged.

397
00:32:07,473 --> 00:32:08,766
Born of eternal night

398
00:32:08,891 --> 00:32:11,727
"the Dark Elves come to
steal away the light."

399
00:32:12,186 --> 00:32:15,665
I know these stories. Mother
told them to us as children.

400
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:19,001
Their leader Malekith made a
weapon out of that darkness

401
00:32:19,026 --> 00:32:20,670
and it was called the Aether.

402
00:32:20,695 --> 00:32:23,798
While the other relics
often appear as stones

403
00:32:23,823 --> 00:32:26,492
the Aether is fluid
and ever changing.

404
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:29,245
It changes matter
into dark matter.

405
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,957
It seeks out host bodies, drawing
strength from their life-force.

406
00:32:34,208 --> 00:32:37,169
Malekith sought to use
the Aether's power

407
00:32:37,336 --> 00:32:41,090
to return the universe
to one of darkness.

408
00:32:41,757 --> 00:32:44,443
But, after eternities
of bloodshed

409
00:32:44,468 --> 00:32:47,054
my father Bor finally triumphed

410
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:51,726
ushering in a peace that
lasted thousands of years.

411
00:32:52,727 --> 00:32:53,894
What happened?

412
00:32:55,187 --> 00:32:57,106
He killed them all.

413
00:32:57,231 --> 00:32:59,458
Are you certain?

414
00:32:59,483 --> 00:33:01,563
The Aether was said to have
been destroyed with them,

415
00:33:01,569 --> 00:33:02,820
and yet here it is.

416
00:33:04,238 --> 00:33:06,407
The Dark Elves are dead.

417
00:33:07,074 --> 00:33:10,594
Does your book happen to mention
how to get it out of me?

418
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:11,620
No.

419
00:33:12,621 --> 00:33:14,248
It does not.

420
00:33:24,091 --> 00:33:26,969
The worlds are nearly aligned.

421
00:33:32,391 --> 00:33:34,143
You will be the
last of the Kursed.

422
00:33:35,311 --> 00:33:36,937
Let my life be sacrificed.

423
00:33:37,897 --> 00:33:40,608
It is no less than
our people did,

424
00:33:41,275 --> 00:33:42,443
or you have done.

425
00:33:50,242 --> 00:33:52,203
You will become darkness,

426
00:33:53,412 --> 00:33:57,124
cursed to this existence
until it consumes you.

427
00:34:02,379 --> 00:34:06,258
Until then, no power our
enemies possess can stop you.

428
00:34:09,345 --> 00:34:16,143
I will tear down their defenses and
ensure your return to a universe reborn.

429
00:34:38,374 --> 00:34:41,377
Acting as caretakers to these
scoundrels is beneath us.

430
00:34:41,544 --> 00:34:43,687
Oh, please! If they
were beneath you,

431
00:34:43,712 --> 00:34:45,840
my rotund friend,
they'd all be dead.

432
00:35:00,521 --> 00:35:02,523
- Keep in line!
- Move it!

433
00:35:04,024 --> 00:35:07,695
Odin continues to
bring me new friends.

434
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,822
How thoughtful.

435
00:35:10,072 --> 00:35:13,534
The books I sent, do
they not interest you?

436
00:35:14,034 --> 00:35:17,388
Is that how I am to while
away eternity? Reading?

437
00:35:17,413 --> 00:35:20,599
I've done everything in my power
to make you comfortable, Loki.

438
00:35:20,624 --> 00:35:21,667
Have you?

439
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,545
Does Odin share your concern?

440
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:27,548
Does Thor?

441
00:35:27,715 --> 00:35:31,402
It must be so inconvenient, them
asking after me day and night.

442
00:35:31,427 --> 00:35:34,555
You know full well it was your
actions that brought you here.

443
00:35:35,097 --> 00:35:36,432
My actions?

444
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:39,910
I was merely giving truth to the lie
that I had been fed my entire life...

445
00:35:39,935 --> 00:35:41,662
That I was born to be a king.

446
00:35:41,687 --> 00:35:43,706
A king?

447
00:35:43,731 --> 00:35:45,733
A true king admits his faults.

448
00:35:45,858 --> 00:35:47,298
What of the lives
you took on Earth?

449
00:35:47,443 --> 00:35:49,086
A mere handful
compared to the number

450
00:35:49,111 --> 00:35:50,905
that Odin has taken himself.

451
00:35:51,071 --> 00:35:53,741
- Your father...
- He's not my father!

452
00:35:56,619 --> 00:35:58,829
Then am I not your mother?

453
00:36:04,043 --> 00:36:06,003
You're not.

454
00:36:09,798 --> 00:36:14,762
You're always so perceptive
about everyone but yourself.

455
00:36:29,944 --> 00:36:33,113
When you came for me, you
knew I was in trouble.

456
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,490
Heimdall had lost sight of you.

457
00:36:34,615 --> 00:36:36,283
You were no longer on Earth.

458
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:37,743
How is that possible?

459
00:36:37,952 --> 00:36:39,970
I believe you were
and you weren't.

460
00:36:39,995 --> 00:36:42,873
The Nine Realms travel
within Yggdrasil

461
00:36:43,165 --> 00:36:46,418
orbiting Midgard much the way
your planets orbit the sun.

462
00:36:46,585 --> 00:36:50,773
And every 5,000 years, the
worlds align perfectly

463
00:36:50,798 --> 00:36:53,008
and we call this
the Convergence.

464
00:36:55,135 --> 00:36:58,806
During this time, the borders
between worlds become blurred.

465
00:36:59,473 --> 00:37:02,268
It's possible you found
one of these points.

466
00:37:04,311 --> 00:37:06,522
We are lucky that
it remained open.

467
00:37:06,689 --> 00:37:10,943
Once the worlds pass
out of alignment

468
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:14,405
then the connection is lost.

469
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:29,545
I like the way you
explain things.

470
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:33,215
What's going to happen to me?

471
00:37:33,382 --> 00:37:34,967
I'll find a way to
save you, Jane.

472
00:37:35,134 --> 00:37:38,304
- Your father said there was... - My
father doesn't know everything.

473
00:37:38,512 --> 00:37:40,180
Don't let him hear you say that.

474
00:37:41,557 --> 00:37:44,326
Jane Foster...
Please meet Frigga,

475
00:37:44,351 --> 00:37:46,270
Queen of Asgard, and my mother.

476
00:37:49,023 --> 00:37:50,482
Hi.

477
00:38:39,615 --> 00:38:41,033
Move!

478
00:39:27,621 --> 00:39:28,872
To the dungeons!

479
00:39:29,248 --> 00:39:30,249
Come on!

480
00:39:54,064 --> 00:39:56,483
You might want to take
the stairs to the left.

481
00:40:07,536 --> 00:40:08,871
The prisons.

482
00:40:09,037 --> 00:40:10,831
- Loki...
- Go.

483
00:40:10,998 --> 00:40:12,833
I will look after her.

484
00:40:24,261 --> 00:40:25,862
It's as if they resent
being imprisoned!

485
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:32,686
- There's no pleasing
some creatures.

486
00:40:40,694 --> 00:40:42,855
Return to your cells, no
further harm will come to you.

487
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,198
You have my word.

488
00:40:46,033 --> 00:40:48,368
Very well, you do
not have my word.

489
00:40:58,253 --> 00:41:00,255
Send a squadron to
the weapons vault.

490
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,925
Defend it at all costs.
Secure the dungeon.

491
00:41:03,091 --> 00:41:04,676
- Odin.
- Frigga.

492
00:41:05,552 --> 00:41:06,553
Go!

493
00:41:07,346 --> 00:41:08,597
It's a skirmish.

494
00:41:08,722 --> 00:41:09,948
Nothing to fear.

495
00:41:09,973 --> 00:41:11,475
You've never been
a very good liar.

496
00:41:12,434 --> 00:41:13,535
Take her to your chambers.

497
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,437
I'll come for you
when it's safe.

498
00:41:15,562 --> 00:41:17,122
You take care.

499
00:41:17,147 --> 00:41:18,268
Despite all I have survived,

500
00:41:19,066 --> 00:41:21,777
my queen still worries over me.

501
00:41:21,891 --> 00:41:23,212
It's only because
I worry over you

502
00:41:23,237 --> 00:41:25,072
that you have survived.

503
00:41:27,574 --> 00:41:28,784
Listen to me now.

504
00:41:28,951 --> 00:41:31,912
I need you to do everything
I ask, no questions.

505
00:41:32,037 --> 00:41:33,205
Yes, ma'am.

506
00:42:14,246 --> 00:42:15,414
Oh!

507
00:45:45,791 --> 00:45:47,167
- Ow!
- Ah!

508
00:46:42,764 --> 00:46:45,892
The throne of Asgard is
destroyed! To the king!

509
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,701
Frigga.

510
00:47:11,501 --> 00:47:13,920
Stand down, creature,

511
00:47:14,087 --> 00:47:15,772
and you may still survive this.

512
00:47:15,797 --> 00:47:17,883
I have survived worse, woman.

513
00:47:19,342 --> 00:47:20,719
Who are you?

514
00:47:21,261 --> 00:47:23,305
I am Malekith.

515
00:47:23,471 --> 00:47:26,099
And I would have what is mine.

516
00:47:38,361 --> 00:47:39,362
Ah!

517
00:47:56,755 --> 00:47:58,924
You have taken something, child.

518
00:47:59,966 --> 00:48:01,009
Give it back.

519
00:48:15,398 --> 00:48:16,483
Witch!

520
00:48:20,195 --> 00:48:21,696
Where is the Aether?

521
00:48:21,821 --> 00:48:24,115
I'll never tell you.

522
00:48:25,116 --> 00:48:26,326
I believe you.

523
00:48:28,828 --> 00:48:30,997
No!

524
00:51:57,745 --> 00:51:59,914
The universe rotates
on a 5,000 year cycle

525
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:03,168
and once a cycle, all
the worlds align.

526
00:52:03,835 --> 00:52:06,754
Imagine... Imagine that
this is our world.

527
00:52:07,505 --> 00:52:09,549
Oh, thank you. And
this is another world.

528
00:52:09,716 --> 00:52:11,676
Normally, they're separate.

529
00:52:11,843 --> 00:52:13,611
But during the Alignment,

530
00:52:13,636 --> 00:52:17,182
everything is connected,
all nine realms.

531
00:52:17,348 --> 00:52:19,576
All nine realms are passing
through each other

532
00:52:19,601 --> 00:52:21,936
and gravity, light,
and even matter,

533
00:52:22,228 --> 00:52:24,647
is crashing from one
world to the other.

534
00:52:26,983 --> 00:52:30,962
But if this happens to us now,
the result will be cataclysmic.

535
00:52:30,987 --> 00:52:35,491
My gravimetric spikes can stabilize
the focal point of the Convergence.

536
00:52:36,201 --> 00:52:38,553
This time, the Alignment

537
00:52:38,578 --> 00:52:41,581
and all the other worlds
would just pass us by.

538
00:52:41,748 --> 00:52:43,249
It's beautiful.

539
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:46,920
It's simple. Any questions?

540
00:52:50,048 --> 00:52:51,090
Yeah.

541
00:52:51,549 --> 00:52:54,260
Can I have my shoe back?

542
00:53:02,018 --> 00:53:06,022
Heal. You will need your
strength to reclaim the Aether.

543
00:53:06,522 --> 00:53:10,109
And when you wake, we
will kill them all.

544
00:53:45,687 --> 00:53:46,980
Jane Foster?

545
00:53:48,648 --> 00:53:50,817
You need to come with us.

546
00:53:52,068 --> 00:53:55,154
We are still unable to
restore the palace shields.

547
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,698
Our artillery
cannot detect them.

548
00:53:56,823 --> 00:53:58,616
Even Heimdall cannot see them.

549
00:54:01,995 --> 00:54:05,915
My king, we are all
but defenseless.

550
00:54:08,501 --> 00:54:09,961
She's your prisoner now?

551
00:54:12,338 --> 00:54:13,673
Leave us.

552
00:54:22,682 --> 00:54:24,851
I do not wish to fight with you.

553
00:54:25,351 --> 00:54:27,161
Nor I with you.

554
00:54:27,186 --> 00:54:29,022
But I intend to pursue Malekith.

555
00:54:29,188 --> 00:54:30,481
We possess the Aether.

556
00:54:31,149 --> 00:54:32,358
Malekith will come to us.

557
00:54:32,525 --> 00:54:34,585
Yes, and he will destroy us.

558
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:36,738
You overestimate the power
of these creatures.

559
00:54:36,863 --> 00:54:39,198
No, I value our people's lives.

560
00:54:39,365 --> 00:54:42,660
I'll take Jane to the Dark World, and
draw the enemy away from Asgard.

561
00:54:43,411 --> 00:54:45,680
When Malekith pulls
the Aether from Jane,

562
00:54:45,705 --> 00:54:47,707
it will be exposed
and vulnerable.

563
00:54:47,874 --> 00:54:49,667
And I will destroy it and him.

564
00:54:51,711 --> 00:54:54,522
If you fail, you
risk this weapon

565
00:54:54,547 --> 00:54:56,382
falling into the hands
of our enemies.

566
00:54:56,507 --> 00:54:58,885
The risk is far greater
if we do nothing.

567
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:00,970
His ship could be over
our heads right now,

568
00:55:01,179 --> 00:55:02,388
we would never even know it.

569
00:55:02,555 --> 00:55:03,781
If and when he comes

570
00:55:03,806 --> 00:55:08,036
his men will fall on
10,000 Asgardian blades.

571
00:55:08,061 --> 00:55:09,479
And how many of our men
shall fall on theirs?

572
00:55:09,604 --> 00:55:11,564
As many as are needed!

573
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:15,735
Ah!

574
00:55:20,531 --> 00:55:22,075
We Will fight!

575
00:55:24,577 --> 00:55:27,121
Till the last Asgardian breath.

576
00:55:27,914 --> 00:55:30,958
Till the last drop
of Asgardian blood.

577
00:55:33,086 --> 00:55:36,214
Then how are you
different from Malekith?

578
00:55:39,425 --> 00:55:42,011
The difference, my son,
is that I will win.

579
00:55:56,317 --> 00:55:59,112
Jane isn't calling me back,
Erik isn't calling me back,

580
00:55:59,237 --> 00:56:01,155
stupid S.H.I.E.L.D.
isn't calling me back.

581
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,174
- What's S.H.I.E.L.D?
- It's a secret.

582
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:05,118
Hey, Erik, it's Darcy again.

583
00:56:05,243 --> 00:56:08,037
Thor came back, he
took Jane to Asgard,

584
00:56:08,287 --> 00:56:11,808
and I'm not sure what
I'm supposed to do.

585
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:13,810
Something else went
missing this week

586
00:56:13,835 --> 00:56:16,963
when astrophysicist
Dr. Erik Selvig

587
00:56:17,088 --> 00:56:20,633
notable for his involvement in
the alien invasion of New York

588
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,093
streaked nude across...

589
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,804
Darcy, you really
need to look at this.

590
00:56:24,971 --> 00:56:26,197
Your friend, Erik...

591
00:56:26,222 --> 00:56:27,974
What was his last name again?

592
00:56:28,933 --> 00:56:32,311
And began shouting at visitors
to the historic site.

593
00:56:32,478 --> 00:56:34,522
He was later taken
into police custody

594
00:56:35,148 --> 00:56:37,442
for psychiatric evaluation.

595
00:56:37,608 --> 00:56:39,652
Police are still
refusing to confirm...

596
00:56:50,163 --> 00:56:52,206
You were not at
Odin's war council.

597
00:56:52,331 --> 00:56:54,667
The Bifrost is closed by
your father's orders.

598
00:56:54,876 --> 00:56:57,545
No one is to come or to go.

599
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:02,341
We face an enemy that is
invisible even to me.

600
00:57:02,508 --> 00:57:06,220
What use is a guardian
such as that?

601
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,433
Malekith will return,
you know this.

602
00:57:12,977 --> 00:57:14,020
I need your help.

603
00:57:14,645 --> 00:57:18,232
I cannot overrule my king's
wishes. Not even for you.

604
00:57:18,357 --> 00:57:19,984
I'm not asking you to.

605
00:57:20,193 --> 00:57:22,528
The realms need their Allfather
strong and unchallenged

606
00:57:22,695 --> 00:57:25,239
whether he is or not.

607
00:57:25,406 --> 00:57:27,175
But he is blinded, Heimdall

608
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,010
by hatred and by grief.

609
00:57:29,035 --> 00:57:30,761
As are we all.

610
00:57:30,786 --> 00:57:32,054
I see clearly enough.

611
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:33,706
The risks are too great.

612
00:57:33,998 --> 00:57:36,709
Everything we do from
here on is a risk.

613
00:57:36,876 --> 00:57:38,586
There is no other way.

614
00:57:42,548 --> 00:57:44,759
What do you require of me?

615
00:57:44,884 --> 00:57:48,429
What I'm about to ask of you is
treason of the highest order.

616
00:57:48,721 --> 00:57:52,767
Success will bring us exile and
failure shall mean our death.

617
00:57:55,645 --> 00:57:59,732
Malekith knew the Aether was
here. He can sense its power.

618
00:58:00,274 --> 00:58:02,443
If we do nothing, he
will come for it again

619
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:06,739
but this time, lay waste
to all of Asgard.

620
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,742
We must move Jane off-world.

621
00:58:09,909 --> 00:58:11,577
The Bifrost has been shut down

622
00:58:11,702 --> 00:58:13,412
and the Tesseract locked
away in the vault.

623
00:58:13,579 --> 00:58:17,767
There are other paths off Asgard.
Ways known only to a few.

624
00:58:17,792 --> 00:58:19,710
One, actually.

625
00:58:21,796 --> 00:58:23,548
No.

626
00:58:27,927 --> 00:58:31,239
Thor. After all this time

627
00:58:31,264 --> 00:58:33,933
and now you come to visit me.

628
00:58:35,142 --> 00:58:36,435
Why?

629
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:40,815
Have you come to gloat? To mock?

630
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,567
Loki, enough.

631
00:58:42,984 --> 00:58:44,819
No more illusions.

632
00:58:51,993 --> 00:58:54,078
Now you see me, brother.

633
00:59:02,795 --> 00:59:04,505
Did she suffer?

634
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:06,966
I did not come here
to share our grief.

635
00:59:07,091 --> 00:59:10,177
Instead I offer you the chance
of a far richer sacrament.

636
00:59:11,596 --> 00:59:12,805
Go on.

637
00:59:12,972 --> 00:59:15,700
I know you seek vengeance
as much as I do.

638
00:59:15,725 --> 00:59:18,686
You help me escape Asgard
and I will grant it to you.

639
00:59:18,978 --> 00:59:22,940
Vengeance and
afterward, this cell.

640
00:59:29,697 --> 00:59:34,493
You must be truly desperate
to come to me for help.

641
00:59:36,162 --> 00:59:37,805
What makes you think
you can trust me?

642
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:39,248
I don't.

643
00:59:40,958 --> 00:59:42,043
Mother did.

644
00:59:43,336 --> 00:59:45,838
But you should know that when we
fought each other in the past,

645
00:59:46,672 --> 00:59:48,190
I did so with a glimmer of hope

646
00:59:48,215 --> 00:59:50,092
that my brother was still
in there somewhere.

647
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:54,180
That hope no longer
exists to protect you.

648
00:59:55,014 --> 00:59:58,392
You betray me, and
I will kill you.

649
01:00:01,062 --> 01:00:02,396
Hmm.

650
01:00:03,898 --> 01:00:05,666
When do we start?

651
01:00:05,691 --> 01:00:07,084
He will betray you.

652
01:00:07,109 --> 01:00:08,736
He will try.

653
01:00:13,324 --> 01:00:15,701
This is so unlike you, brother.

654
01:00:15,868 --> 01:00:17,870
So clandestine.

655
01:00:17,995 --> 01:00:20,236
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather just punch your way out?

656
01:00:20,998 --> 01:00:22,875
If you keep speaking,
I just might.

657
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,835
Fine. As you wish.

658
01:00:25,211 --> 01:00:26,379
I'm not even here.

659
01:00:27,713 --> 01:00:29,215
Is this better?

660
01:00:29,382 --> 01:00:31,884
It's better company at least.

661
01:00:32,009 --> 01:00:35,930
Still, we could be
less conspicuous.

662
01:00:37,515 --> 01:00:39,850
Mmm, brother, you
look ravishing.

663
01:00:41,852 --> 01:00:44,397
It will hurt no less when
I kill you in this form.

664
01:00:44,563 --> 01:00:47,733
Very well. Perhaps you prefer
one of your new companions

665
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,944
given that you seem
to like them so much.

666
01:00:50,528 --> 01:00:52,588
Oh, this is much better.

667
01:00:52,613 --> 01:00:53,614
Ooh.

668
01:00:53,948 --> 01:00:56,575
The costume is a bit much.
So tight.

669
01:00:56,742 --> 01:00:58,035
But the confidence...

670
01:00:58,202 --> 01:01:00,621
I can feel the
righteousness surging.

671
01:01:00,788 --> 01:01:03,249
Hey, do you want to have a
rousing discussion about truth?

672
01:01:03,708 --> 01:01:04,975
Honor? Patriotism?

673
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,001
God bless Amer...

674
01:01:08,713 --> 01:01:10,047
What?

675
01:01:14,552 --> 01:01:16,929
You could at least furnish
me with a weapon.

676
01:01:17,096 --> 01:01:18,973
My dagger, something.

677
01:01:24,478 --> 01:01:25,788
At last.

678
01:01:25,813 --> 01:01:27,523
A little common sense.

679
01:01:33,654 --> 01:01:36,257
And I thought you liked tricks.

680
01:01:36,282 --> 01:01:40,828
Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is
being guarded by a legion of Einherjar

681
01:01:40,995 --> 01:01:42,805
who will see you coming
from Miles away.

682
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:44,540
I won't be the one
who comes for her.

683
01:01:52,339 --> 01:01:53,340
I'm not hungry.

684
01:01:54,133 --> 01:01:58,220
What the... Good. Let's go.

685
01:02:03,601 --> 01:02:04,643
You're...

686
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:06,829
I'm Loki, you may
have heard of me.

687
01:02:06,854 --> 01:02:09,457
That was for New York.

688
01:02:09,482 --> 01:02:10,858
I like her.

689
01:02:10,983 --> 01:02:12,651
And what of the Allfather?

690
01:02:13,319 --> 01:02:17,031
It is my sworn duty to notify him
of crimes against the throne.

691
01:02:17,156 --> 01:02:20,785
You called me here
on an urgent matter.

692
01:02:21,827 --> 01:02:22,828
What is it?

693
01:02:23,287 --> 01:02:24,638
Treason, my lord.

694
01:02:24,663 --> 01:02:25,998
Whose'?

695
01:02:26,707 --> 01:02:27,750
Mine.

696
01:02:28,501 --> 01:02:30,060
My king!

697
01:02:30,085 --> 01:02:32,087
The mortal has been taken.

698
01:02:35,966 --> 01:02:37,026
Stop Thor.

699
01:02:37,051 --> 01:02:39,178
By any means necessary.

700
01:02:41,889 --> 01:02:44,391
There they are! Take them.

701
01:02:44,517 --> 01:02:45,534
On my command.

702
01:02:45,559 --> 01:02:47,770
I'll hold them off. Take her.

703
01:02:48,395 --> 01:02:49,814
Thank you.

704
01:02:52,525 --> 01:02:54,777
Betray him, and I'll kill you.

705
01:02:57,029 --> 01:02:59,615
It's good to see you, too, Sif.

706
01:03:05,204 --> 01:03:09,542
Assuming you can get Loki's help
and you can free this mortal

707
01:03:09,667 --> 01:03:11,227
what good would it do?

708
01:03:11,252 --> 01:03:14,188
We'd all be dead the minute we
step one foot outside the palace.

709
01:03:14,213 --> 01:03:17,424
That, my friend, is why we
won't be leaving by foot.

710
01:03:21,554 --> 01:03:23,364
I will give you as
much time as I can.

711
01:03:23,389 --> 01:03:25,224
Thank you, my friend.

712
01:03:29,395 --> 01:03:32,565
If you even think about
betraying him...

713
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:34,375
You'll kill me?

714
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,402
Evidently, there will be a line.

715
01:03:51,709 --> 01:03:53,794
I thought you said you knew
how to fly this thing.

716
01:03:53,961 --> 01:03:55,754
I said, "How hard could it be?"

717
01:03:59,133 --> 01:04:00,134
They're on the ship!

718
01:04:00,968 --> 01:04:02,261
Get to the ship!

719
01:04:05,973 --> 01:04:08,617
Well, whatever you're doing,
brother, I suggest you do it faster.

720
01:04:08,642 --> 01:04:11,020
- Shut up, Loki.

721
01:04:12,132 --> 01:04:13,372
You must have missed something.

722
01:04:13,397 --> 01:04:16,166
No, I didn't. I'm pressing
every button on this thing.

723
01:04:16,191 --> 01:04:17,776
No, don't hit it.
Just press it gently.

724
01:04:17,902 --> 01:04:19,737
I'm pressing it gently,
it's networking!

725
01:04:22,865 --> 01:04:23,866
Ha, ha!

726
01:04:27,494 --> 01:04:29,079
Get him! Get him!

727
01:04:57,650 --> 01:05:00,152
- I think you missed a column.
- Shut up!

728
01:05:07,279 --> 01:05:08,719
Look, why don't you
let me take over?

729
01:05:08,744 --> 01:05:09,995
I'm clearly the better pilot.

730
01:05:10,287 --> 01:05:12,206
Is that right? Well,
out of the two of us,

731
01:05:12,331 --> 01:05:13,832
which one can actually fly?

732
01:05:24,343 --> 01:05:25,986
Oh, dear. Is she dead?

733
01:05:26,011 --> 01:05:27,012
Jane.

734
01:05:27,805 --> 01:05:28,806
I'm okay.

735
01:05:30,766 --> 01:05:31,934
Ah!

736
01:05:35,938 --> 01:05:37,272
Not a word.

737
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,776
Now they're following us.

738
01:05:46,156 --> 01:05:47,282
Now they're firing at us.

739
01:05:47,449 --> 01:05:48,842
Yeah, thank you for
the commentary, Loki,

740
01:05:48,867 --> 01:05:50,202
it's not at all distracting!

741
01:05:54,748 --> 01:05:57,376
Well done. You just
decapitated your grandfather.

742
01:06:08,804 --> 01:06:10,139
You know, this is wonderful.

743
01:06:10,264 --> 01:06:12,558
This is a tremendous idea.

744
01:06:12,725 --> 01:06:15,811
Let's steal the biggest, most
obvious ship in the universe

745
01:06:15,978 --> 01:06:17,287
and escape in that.

746
01:06:17,312 --> 01:06:18,539
Flying around the city,

747
01:06:18,564 --> 01:06:20,941
smashing into everything in
sight so everyone can see us.

748
01:06:21,066 --> 01:06:22,786
It's brilliant, Thor!
It's truly brilliant!

749
01:06:37,374 --> 01:06:38,976
I see your time in the dungeons

750
01:06:39,001 --> 01:06:41,587
has made you no less
graceful, Loki.

751
01:06:45,799 --> 01:06:47,760
You lied to me.

752
01:06:49,011 --> 01:06:50,446
I'm impressed.

753
01:06:50,471 --> 01:06:51,989
I'm glad you're pleased.

754
01:06:52,014 --> 01:06:53,073
Now, do as you promised.

755
01:06:53,098 --> 01:06:54,933
And take us to your
secret pathway.

756
01:07:18,165 --> 01:07:19,708
- Fandral.
- Right.

757
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:24,421
For Asgard.

758
01:07:30,052 --> 01:07:31,136
Nothing personal, boys.

759
01:07:46,443 --> 01:07:47,878
Loki...

760
01:07:47,903 --> 01:07:51,298
If it were easy,
everyone would do it.

761
01:07:51,323 --> 01:07:53,325
- Are you mad?
- Possibly.

762
01:08:08,924 --> 01:08:10,509
LON'. Ya-den!

763
01:08:16,056 --> 01:08:19,393
We must strike now.

764
01:08:20,435 --> 01:08:21,436
No.

765
01:08:23,063 --> 01:08:28,694
Asgard is meaningless.

766
01:08:32,906 --> 01:08:34,825
The Aether has found
its way home.

767
01:08:50,591 --> 01:08:54,153
What I could do with the power
that flows through those veins.

768
01:08:54,178 --> 01:08:56,847
It would consume you.

769
01:08:57,806 --> 01:08:59,391
She's holding up all right.

770
01:09:00,225 --> 01:09:01,351
For now.

771
01:09:01,894 --> 01:09:04,438
She's strong in ways
you'd never even know.

772
01:09:04,563 --> 01:09:05,956
Say goodbye.

773
01:09:05,981 --> 01:09:07,774
Not this day.

774
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:10,694
This day, the next, a hundred
years, it's nothing.

775
01:09:11,945 --> 01:09:13,488
It's a heartbeat.

776
01:09:13,906 --> 01:09:15,908
You'll never be ready.

777
01:09:16,325 --> 01:09:17,885
The only woman whose
love you've prized

778
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:19,761
will be snatched from you.

779
01:09:19,786 --> 01:09:21,079
And will that satisfy you?

780
01:09:21,205 --> 01:09:22,806
Satisfaction is
not in my nature.

781
01:09:22,831 --> 01:09:25,042
Surrender is not in mine.

782
01:09:25,834 --> 01:09:27,394
- The son of Odin...
- No.

783
01:09:27,419 --> 01:09:29,463
Not just of Odin.

784
01:09:29,588 --> 01:09:31,924
You think you alone
were loved of Mother?

785
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:34,092
You had her tricks,
but I had her trust.

786
01:09:34,218 --> 01:09:35,510
Trust?

787
01:09:36,428 --> 01:09:37,930
Was that her last expression?

788
01:09:38,555 --> 01:09:40,766
Trust? When you let her die?

789
01:09:40,891 --> 01:09:43,660
- What help were you in your cell?
- Who put me there?

790
01:09:43,685 --> 01:09:45,103
Who put me there?

791
01:09:45,229 --> 01:09:46,230
You know damn well!

792
01:09:46,939 --> 01:09:48,690
- You know damn well who!

793
01:09:54,947 --> 01:09:57,616
She wouldn't want us to fight.

794
01:09:58,742 --> 01:10:01,286
Well, she wouldn't
exactly be shocked.

795
01:10:05,999 --> 01:10:08,502
I wish I could trust you.

796
01:10:23,016 --> 01:10:24,977
Trust my rage.

797
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:34,528
You'll have to sign for your
father's belongings, Mr. Selvig.

798
01:10:35,195 --> 01:10:36,363
What?

799
01:10:36,488 --> 01:10:37,881
Oh, yeah.

800
01:10:37,906 --> 01:10:40,909
My father, Dr. Erik Selvig.

801
01:10:42,619 --> 01:10:45,055
One man's leather wallet, brown.

802
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,541
One key ring, three keys.

803
01:10:47,666 --> 01:10:49,584
Prescription medicine...

804
01:10:50,335 --> 01:10:51,586
Various.

805
01:10:54,256 --> 01:10:56,008
- And...
- Erik.

806
01:10:57,592 --> 01:10:59,069
- These.
- Yeah.

807
01:10:59,094 --> 01:11:00,304
Those.

808
01:11:00,804 --> 01:11:02,097
Thank goodness.

809
01:11:03,765 --> 01:11:04,975
Erik.

810
01:11:06,768 --> 01:11:07,894
Yes?

811
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:09,688
It's, uh, Darcy.

812
01:11:09,813 --> 01:11:10,897
Darcy.

813
01:11:13,108 --> 01:11:14,901
So good to see you.

814
01:11:15,027 --> 01:11:16,069
Oh, I missed you, too.

815
01:11:16,194 --> 01:11:17,671
How did you find me?

816
01:11:17,696 --> 01:11:18,947
You were naked on TV.

817
01:11:20,324 --> 01:11:22,451
Okay, time to go, lots to do.

818
01:11:24,536 --> 01:11:26,538
Getting weird now.

819
01:11:27,956 --> 01:11:30,083
I should not be left in
charge of stuff like this.

820
01:11:30,208 --> 01:11:34,104
I don't get paid enough. I
don't get paid, period.

821
01:11:34,129 --> 01:11:37,132
I'm Ian by the way,
uh, Darcy's intern.

822
01:11:37,299 --> 01:11:39,468
Yeah, I don't get paid either.

823
01:11:40,344 --> 01:11:41,803
Are you all right?

824
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:43,805
I've had a God in my brain.

825
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:46,600
- I don't recommend it.

826
01:11:48,226 --> 01:11:50,579
Dr. Selvig, sir, your
gear is beeping at me.

827
01:11:50,604 --> 01:11:52,981
It's happening. It's
sooner than I calculated.

828
01:11:53,148 --> 01:11:54,775
Wait. What's happening?

829
01:11:58,070 --> 01:11:59,738
Birds?

830
01:11:59,863 --> 01:12:01,298
Birds are happening?

831
01:12:01,323 --> 01:12:03,575
They're starlings. It's
called a murmuration.

832
01:12:03,742 --> 01:12:05,911
My dad, he used to take me
bird watching as a kid.

833
01:12:06,078 --> 01:12:07,579
- Nerd.
- Look!

834
01:12:12,167 --> 01:12:14,336
Where did they go?

835
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:29,434
What the hell was that?

836
01:12:29,935 --> 01:12:31,603
Why are you smiling?

837
01:12:31,770 --> 01:12:33,038
There's nothing more reassuring

838
01:12:33,063 --> 01:12:36,833
than realizing that the world
is crazier than you are.

839
01:12:36,858 --> 01:12:39,736
Take me to Jane's lab.

840
01:12:52,207 --> 01:12:53,667
Jane.

841
01:13:00,298 --> 01:13:01,633
Malekith.

842
01:13:23,905 --> 01:13:25,824
All right. Are you ready?

843
01:13:25,991 --> 01:13:27,242
I am.

844
01:13:40,822 --> 01:13:42,983
You know, this plan of yours
is going to get us killed.

845
01:13:43,008 --> 01:13:44,885
Yes, possibly.

846
01:13:48,513 --> 01:13:49,874
You still don't
trust me, brother?

847
01:13:51,349 --> 01:13:52,642
Would you?

848
01:14:01,568 --> 01:14:02,777
No, I wouldn't.

849
01:14:07,574 --> 01:14:09,034
Thor!

850
01:14:09,868 --> 01:14:11,453
No!

851
01:14:20,754 --> 01:14:23,273
You really think I
cared about Frigga?

852
01:14:23,298 --> 01:14:25,008
About any of you?

853
01:14:28,011 --> 01:14:29,012
All I ever wanted

854
01:14:30,514 --> 01:14:32,766
was you and Odin
dead at my feet!

855
01:14:45,403 --> 01:14:46,404
Malekith!

856
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:50,492
I am Loki of Jotunheim,

857
01:14:50,659 --> 01:14:52,577
- and I bring you a gift.

858
01:14:54,538 --> 01:14:56,431
I ask only one
thing in return...

859
01:14:56,456 --> 01:14:58,308
A good seat from which

860
01:14:58,333 --> 01:14:59,876
- to watch Asgard burn.

861
01:15:00,502 --> 01:15:02,812
He is an enemy of Asgard.

862
01:15:02,837 --> 01:15:05,590
He was a prisoner
in their dungeons.

863
01:15:19,813 --> 01:15:20,939
Look at me.

864
01:16:18,955 --> 01:16:20,457
Loki! NOW!

865
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:42,080
Ah!

866
01:18:36,301 --> 01:18:37,302
Ah!

867
01:19:34,692 --> 01:19:36,903
- Ah!
- No!

868
01:19:46,162 --> 01:19:48,289
See you in hell, monster.

869
01:20:07,141 --> 01:20:08,601
No. No, no, no.

870
01:20:10,937 --> 01:20:13,248
Oh, you fool, you didn't listen.

871
01:20:13,273 --> 01:20:14,274
I know...

872
01:20:15,316 --> 01:20:17,544
I'm a fool, I'm a fool.

873
01:20:17,569 --> 01:20:18,795
Stay with me, okay?

874
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:19,988
I'm sorry.

875
01:20:22,031 --> 01:20:24,242
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Shh...

876
01:20:24,367 --> 01:20:25,660
It's okay.

877
01:20:29,289 --> 01:20:30,790
It's all right.

878
01:20:30,915 --> 01:20:34,419
I'll tell Father what
you did here today.

879
01:20:37,505 --> 01:20:40,425
I didn't do it for him.

880
01:20:48,975 --> 01:20:51,352
No!

881
01:21:45,156 --> 01:21:47,200
He's going to unleash it.

882
01:21:47,325 --> 01:21:52,497
Not just on Asgard, or on a star.
Malekith is going to destroy everything.

883
01:21:52,622 --> 01:21:53,748
How?

884
01:21:54,832 --> 01:21:56,000
Jane, how?

885
01:21:56,125 --> 01:21:59,337
I saw him on Earth. Why
would he go to Earth?

886
01:21:59,921 --> 01:22:01,297
The Convergence.

887
01:22:01,464 --> 01:22:02,690
Oh, God.

888
01:22:02,715 --> 01:22:05,155
None of this would have happened
if I hadn't found the Aether.

889
01:22:05,927 --> 01:22:07,679
Then Malekith would've
only possessed it

890
01:22:07,804 --> 01:22:09,530
that much sooner.

891
01:22:09,555 --> 01:22:12,016
I only found it because
I was looking for you.

892
01:22:12,642 --> 01:22:13,893
Jane.

893
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,230
Now we're trapped here.

894
01:22:23,778 --> 01:22:24,988
It's not me.

895
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,490
Hello?

896
01:22:27,615 --> 01:22:28,825
Hi, Jane, it's Richard.

897
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:30,743
Richard? Where are you?

898
01:22:30,868 --> 01:22:32,078
I'm still at the office.

899
01:22:32,203 --> 01:22:34,222
It's been a crazy
day here today.

900
01:22:34,247 --> 01:22:36,165
- Oh, my God, this is amazing.
- Is it?

901
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:37,558
I quite enjoyed our lunch

902
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:39,727
despite never actually
ordering anything.

903
01:22:39,752 --> 01:22:41,229
How am I getting service here?

904
01:22:41,254 --> 01:22:43,381
Is this a bad time? Do you
want me to try you later?

905
01:22:43,506 --> 01:22:46,676
No, no, no. Please, whatever you
do, do not hang up the phone.

906
01:22:47,552 --> 01:22:48,736
Okay, then.

907
01:22:48,761 --> 01:22:51,197
I was just wondering if
you want to try again.

908
01:22:51,222 --> 01:22:52,740
Uh, maybe dinner next time.

909
01:22:52,765 --> 01:22:54,392
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

910
01:22:54,517 --> 01:22:56,769
- Just stay on the phone, okay?
- Yeah, I will.

911
01:22:56,894 --> 01:22:58,855
On, my God.

912
01:23:02,734 --> 01:23:03,876
Am I interrupting something?

913
01:23:03,901 --> 01:23:05,611
No, no, no. Nothing at all.

914
01:23:05,778 --> 01:23:06,838
Come on.

915
01:23:06,863 --> 01:23:07,947
I'm losing you there.
Are you in a tunnel?

916
01:23:08,114 --> 01:23:09,590
Where are we going?

917
01:23:09,615 --> 01:23:10,616
Hello?

918
01:23:10,742 --> 01:23:12,577
Why are there so
many shoes in here?

919
01:23:14,162 --> 01:23:15,997
I'll just text her.

920
01:23:28,301 --> 01:23:29,469
So, who's Richard?

921
01:23:29,635 --> 01:23:31,095
Really?

922
01:23:39,437 --> 01:23:40,955
- Jane!
- Hey.

923
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:42,790
You can't just leave like that.

924
01:23:42,815 --> 01:23:44,108
The whole world is going crazy.

925
01:23:44,275 --> 01:23:46,110
All the stuff we
saw is spreading.

926
01:23:47,612 --> 01:23:49,447
- Did you go to a party?
- Erik?

927
01:23:49,572 --> 01:23:53,242
Jane! How wonderful.

928
01:23:54,118 --> 01:23:55,161
Oh!

929
01:23:55,453 --> 01:23:57,388
- You've been to Asgard.
- Where are your pants?

930
01:23:57,413 --> 01:23:59,165
Oh, he, uh... He says
it helps him think.

931
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:00,933
Okay, well, I'm going to need
everything you got on this.

932
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:03,669
All the work you've been doing on
gravimetric anomalies, everything.

933
01:24:03,795 --> 01:24:05,021
Okay.

934
01:24:05,046 --> 01:24:07,131
- Are you well, Erik?

935
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:09,092
Your brother's not
coming, is he?

936
01:24:10,093 --> 01:24:11,486
Loki is dead.

937
01:24:11,511 --> 01:24:12,595
Oh, thank God!

938
01:24:13,763 --> 01:24:15,973
I... I meant, I'm so sorry.

939
01:24:16,099 --> 01:24:17,642
Thank you.

940
01:24:41,249 --> 01:24:43,126
Forgive me, my liege.

941
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:46,462
I've returned from the
Dark World with news.

942
01:24:48,923 --> 01:24:50,007
Thor?

943
01:24:50,675 --> 01:24:55,096
There was no sign of Thor,
or the weapon, but...

944
01:24:56,931 --> 01:24:58,141
What?

945
01:25:01,102 --> 01:25:02,728
We found a body.

946
01:25:07,441 --> 01:25:08,568
Loki.

947
01:25:12,655 --> 01:25:14,490
Malekith is going to fire
the Aether at a spot

948
01:25:14,657 --> 01:25:16,576
where all the nine
worlds are connecting.

949
01:25:16,701 --> 01:25:19,220
Amplifying the weapon's impact.

950
01:25:19,245 --> 01:25:20,663
For each additional world,

951
01:25:20,788 --> 01:25:22,874
the power will increase
exponentially.

952
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:26,043
The effect would be universal.

953
01:25:26,169 --> 01:25:27,854
But the Alignment
is only temporary.

954
01:25:27,879 --> 01:25:30,923
He must be in exactly the right
place at the right time.

955
01:25:31,048 --> 01:25:32,717
Well, how do we
know where that is?

956
01:25:33,926 --> 01:25:36,345
We follow the directions.

957
01:25:36,512 --> 01:25:37,763
This has happened before

958
01:25:37,889 --> 01:25:41,225
thousands of years ago, and the
Ancients were there to see it.

959
01:25:41,893 --> 01:25:43,269
All the great constructions,

960
01:25:44,103 --> 01:25:46,873
the Mayans, the
Chinese, the Egyptians.

961
01:25:46,898 --> 01:25:50,376
They made use of the gravitational
effects of the Convergence.

962
01:25:50,401 --> 01:25:52,545
And they left us a map.

963
01:25:52,570 --> 01:25:53,988
Stonehenge,

964
01:25:55,448 --> 01:25:57,800
Snow-don, the Great Orme.

965
01:25:57,825 --> 01:25:59,702
These are all coordinates
taking us...

966
01:26:01,078 --> 01:26:02,079
Here.

967
01:26:04,582 --> 01:26:06,100
Greenwich?

968
01:26:06,125 --> 01:26:08,753
The walls between worlds
will be almost non-existent.

969
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:10,271
Physics is going
to go ballistic.

970
01:26:10,296 --> 01:26:12,131
Increases and
decreases in gravity,

971
01:26:12,256 --> 01:26:13,774
spatial extrusions.

972
01:26:13,799 --> 01:26:16,427
The very fabric of reality
is going to be torn apart.

973
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:21,933
I better get my pants.

974
01:26:23,517 --> 01:26:24,852
Focus! This is important.

975
01:26:25,019 --> 01:26:26,479
We have to hammer them
in all around the site

976
01:26:26,604 --> 01:26:28,898
and then Jane and Erik will
activate them from the tower.

977
01:26:29,232 --> 01:26:30,691
They're taped together.

978
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:33,194
Do you even know what
these things do?

979
01:26:33,569 --> 01:26:35,196
Uh... No.

980
01:26:35,529 --> 01:26:36,530
Neither do I.

981
01:26:41,535 --> 01:26:42,620
Shh!

982
01:26:45,331 --> 01:26:47,333
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Right.

983
01:27:00,137 --> 01:27:02,265
Holy... Shit.

984
01:27:14,777 --> 01:27:15,778
Ah!

985
01:28:20,801 --> 01:28:23,095
You needn't have come
so far, Asgardian.

986
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:25,431
Death would've come
to you soon enough.

987
01:28:25,556 --> 01:28:27,116
Not by your hand.

988
01:28:27,141 --> 01:28:29,952
Your universe was
never meant to be.

989
01:28:29,977 --> 01:28:33,122
Your world and your family

990
01:28:33,147 --> 01:28:35,274
will be extinguished!

991
01:28:37,485 --> 01:28:38,903
We're running out of time.

992
01:28:39,028 --> 01:28:41,422
- Almost there. - Are you
sure this is going to work?

993
01:28:41,447 --> 01:28:44,033
These devices were made to detect
anomalies, not cause them.

994
01:28:45,076 --> 01:28:46,160
Oh, come on.

995
01:28:51,415 --> 01:28:53,542
Come on, Darcy.

996
01:29:03,969 --> 01:29:05,930
You know, with all that power,

997
01:29:06,055 --> 01:29:07,556
I thought you'd hit harder.

998
01:29:32,957 --> 01:29:34,041
Done.

999
01:29:40,965 --> 01:29:43,676
The Convergence will be in
full effect in seven minutes.

1000
01:29:43,801 --> 01:29:46,002
That just means we have to
keep Malekith busy for eight.

1001
01:29:52,476 --> 01:29:54,353
Okay, you might want to
hold on to something.

1002
01:30:00,025 --> 01:30:01,460
That is awesome!

1003
01:30:01,485 --> 01:30:03,045
How did you do that?

1004
01:30:03,070 --> 01:30:04,422
Well, the gravitational fields

1005
01:30:04,447 --> 01:30:06,799
interact with the weak spots
between worlds, creating...

1006
01:30:06,824 --> 01:30:08,242
Ooh, get the guy with the sword!

1007
01:30:11,662 --> 01:30:13,539
- Oops.
- Let's go.

1008
01:30:13,664 --> 01:30:15,082
Um...

1009
01:30:15,499 --> 01:30:17,168
- What the hell just happened?

1010
01:30:17,334 --> 01:30:18,961
Move!

1011
01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:38,063
What are you all doing?

1012
01:30:38,189 --> 01:30:39,857
You need to get
out of here, now!

1013
01:30:39,982 --> 01:30:41,525
You're joking, right?

1014
01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:42,668
That's Thor out there.

1015
01:30:42,693 --> 01:30:44,820
He's waving his hammer
around and everything!

1016
01:31:43,629 --> 01:31:45,130
Ah!

1017
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:04,692
Confirming ship is hostile.

1018
01:32:04,858 --> 01:32:06,794
Confirmed, ship is hostile.

1019
01:32:06,819 --> 01:32:08,295
You have permission to engage.

1020
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,588
Roger.

1021
01:32:09,613 --> 01:32:10,739
Missiles locked.

1022
01:32:11,574 --> 01:32:13,325
Missiles away.

1023
01:32:14,785 --> 01:32:16,011
Missiles off target.

1024
01:32:16,036 --> 01:32:18,806
I repeat, target missed.
I'm losing control.

1025
01:32:18,831 --> 01:32:21,625
Mayday! Mayday! Lost
positive control.

1026
01:32:23,752 --> 01:32:24,812
What are you doing?

1027
01:32:24,837 --> 01:32:26,338
My signal's not connecting.

1028
01:32:28,632 --> 01:32:29,692
Jane!

1029
01:32:29,717 --> 01:32:30,801
Come on.

1030
01:33:13,093 --> 01:33:14,386
Are you all right?

1031
01:33:14,553 --> 01:33:15,554
You saved my life.

1032
01:33:19,183 --> 01:33:20,242
Yeah.

1033
01:33:20,267 --> 01:33:21,560
I guess I did.

1034
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:30,361
Mmm.

1035
01:33:30,736 --> 01:33:31,737
Darcy?

1036
01:33:32,071 --> 01:33:33,130
- Jane!

1037
01:33:33,155 --> 01:33:35,491
- Ian!
- Selvig!

1038
01:33:36,033 --> 01:33:37,201
Mew mew!

1039
01:33:40,829 --> 01:33:42,706
Mind the gap.

1040
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:45,998
How do I get to Greenwich?

1041
01:33:47,044 --> 01:33:49,046
Take this train. Three stops.

1042
01:33:51,131 --> 01:33:53,634
Mind the gap.

1043
01:33:55,552 --> 01:33:57,513
Sorry. Sorry.

1044
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,677
- We're out of time.
- Jane.

1045
01:34:37,803 --> 01:34:38,929
Jane!

1046
01:35:04,872 --> 01:35:06,290
Thor!

1047
01:35:07,291 --> 01:35:08,333
We're too late.

1048
01:35:09,710 --> 01:35:11,795
The Convergence is at its peak.

1049
01:35:12,671 --> 01:35:13,797
Can those things stop him?

1050
01:35:13,922 --> 01:35:15,007
Not from here.

1051
01:35:15,174 --> 01:35:17,968
We can't get close enough.

1052
01:35:19,011 --> 01:35:20,262
I can.

1053
01:35:45,579 --> 01:35:46,580
Malekith!

1054
01:35:53,962 --> 01:35:57,216
Darkness returns, Asgardian.

1055
01:35:57,341 --> 01:36:00,694
Have you come to witness
the end of your universe?

1056
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:02,763
I've come to accept
your surrender.

1057
01:36:22,324 --> 01:36:24,409
You think you can stop this?

1058
01:36:25,118 --> 01:36:27,913
The Aether cannot be destroyed.

1059
01:36:28,038 --> 01:36:29,706
But you can.

1060
01:37:15,252 --> 01:37:17,254
Thor! No.

1061
01:37:27,598 --> 01:37:28,640
Jane!

1062
01:37:50,203 --> 01:37:51,204
Ah!

1063
01:37:59,338 --> 01:38:00,923
Everybody okay?

1064
01:38:45,509 --> 01:38:47,427
He's gonna come back.

1065
01:38:49,930 --> 01:38:51,807
Except, you know,

1066
01:38:51,932 --> 01:38:54,159
last time he was gone
for, like, two years.

1067
01:38:54,184 --> 01:38:56,103
Well, it's only been
two days, so...

1068
01:38:58,021 --> 01:38:59,856
Did he say anything
before he left?

1069
01:38:59,982 --> 01:39:02,209
Yeah, he had to figure some
stuff out with his father.

1070
01:39:02,234 --> 01:39:06,363
He kinda committed treason...
On our way out.

1071
01:39:11,201 --> 01:39:12,244
Oh.

1072
01:39:14,871 --> 01:39:19,543
You once said there would never
be a wiser king than me.

1073
01:39:19,710 --> 01:39:20,711
You were wrong.

1074
01:39:21,294 --> 01:39:25,232
The Alignment has brought
all the realms together.

1075
01:39:25,257 --> 01:39:28,385
Every one of them saw you
offer your life to save them.

1076
01:39:29,052 --> 01:39:33,473
What can Asgard offer
its new king in return?

1077
01:39:34,641 --> 01:39:36,518
My life.

1078
01:39:37,644 --> 01:39:40,414
Father, I cannot
be king of Asgard.

1079
01:39:40,439 --> 01:39:45,235
I will protect Asgard and all the
realms with my last and every breath,

1080
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:47,612
but I cannot do so
from that chair.

1081
01:39:47,738 --> 01:39:51,867
Loki, for all his grave imbalance,
understood rule as I know I never will.

1082
01:39:52,868 --> 01:39:55,537
The brutality, the sacrifice...

1083
01:39:55,704 --> 01:39:57,222
It changes you.

1084
01:39:57,247 --> 01:40:00,667
I'd rather be a good
man than a great king.

1085
01:40:01,251 --> 01:40:06,106
Is this my son I hear,
or the woman he loves?

1086
01:40:06,131 --> 01:40:08,675
When you speak, do I never
hear Mother's voice?

1087
01:40:10,677 --> 01:40:13,280
This is not for Jane, Father.

1088
01:40:13,305 --> 01:40:15,782
She does not know what
I came here to say.

1089
01:40:15,807 --> 01:40:19,144
Now, forbid me to see her, or
say she can rule at my side.

1090
01:40:19,269 --> 01:40:20,604
It changes nothing.

1091
01:40:21,188 --> 01:40:24,524
One son who wanted
the throne too much,

1092
01:40:25,442 --> 01:40:27,569
another who will not take it.

1093
01:40:28,111 --> 01:40:29,863
Is this my legacy?

1094
01:40:30,030 --> 01:40:31,615
Loki died with honor.

1095
01:40:32,574 --> 01:40:34,009
I shall try to live the same.

1096
01:40:34,034 --> 01:40:35,452
Is that not legacy enough?

1097
01:40:46,463 --> 01:40:48,799
It belongs to you.

1098
01:40:49,549 --> 01:40:51,359
If you are worthy of it.

1099
01:40:51,384 --> 01:40:53,887
I shall try to be.

1100
01:40:55,305 --> 01:41:00,018
I cannot give you my blessing,
nor can I wish you good fortune.

1101
01:41:00,977 --> 01:41:02,646
I know.

1102
01:41:05,482 --> 01:41:08,819
If I were proud of the
man my son had become,

1103
01:41:09,319 --> 01:41:11,655
even that, I could not say.

1104
01:41:14,157 --> 01:41:17,786
It would speak only
from my heart.

1105
01:41:19,162 --> 01:41:20,580
Go,

1106
01:41:21,665 --> 01:41:23,166
my son.

1107
01:41:25,293 --> 01:41:26,545
Thank you, Father.

1108
01:41:42,144 --> 01:41:43,186
No.

1109
01:41:44,521 --> 01:41:46,189
Thank you.

1110
01:44:04,202 --> 01:44:06,621
I present to you,

1111
01:44:07,330 --> 01:44:10,834
Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.

1112
01:44:12,335 --> 01:44:13,503
Whoa...

1113
01:44:16,589 --> 01:44:21,136
Asgardians, it's an honor.

1114
01:44:24,848 --> 01:44:26,933
You know why we're here.

1115
01:44:30,645 --> 01:44:32,564
Of course.

1116
01:44:33,398 --> 01:44:35,650
But, if I may ask,

1117
01:44:35,817 --> 01:44:39,696
why not keep it secure
in your own vault?

1118
01:44:39,821 --> 01:44:42,741
The Tesseract is
already on Asgard.

1119
01:44:42,866 --> 01:44:46,411
It is not wise to keep two
Infinity Stones so close together.

1120
01:44:47,037 --> 01:44:49,539
That's very wise.

1121
01:44:59,382 --> 01:45:00,759
I can assure you,

1122
01:45:02,010 --> 01:45:07,223
it will be absolutely safe here,

1123
01:45:09,434 --> 01:45:11,936
in my collection.

1124
01:45:13,104 --> 01:45:15,523
See that it is.

1125
01:45:34,084 --> 01:45:36,586
One down.

1126
01:45:38,088 --> 01:45:40,590
Five to go.
