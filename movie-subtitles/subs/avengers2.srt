How long before you trust me?

1
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,449
It's not you I don't trust.

1
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,049
Thor, report on the Hulk.

1
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,084
The gates of Hel are filled with
the screams of his victims.

1
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,964
(GROANS SOFTLY)

1
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,124
But not the screams of the dead, of course.
No, no, wounded screams.

1
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,447
Mainly whimpering,
a great deal of complaining

1
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,565
and tales of sprained deltoids and gout.

1
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,924
Hey, Banner
Dr. Cho is on her way in from Seoul.

1
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,616
Is it okay if she sets up in your lab?

1
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,563
Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.

1
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,966
Thanks. Tell her to prep everything.

1
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,411
Barton's gonna need the full treatment.

1
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,576
- JARVIS:<i> Very good, sir.</i>
- Jarvis, take the wheel.

1
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,886
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,889
<i>Approach vector is locked.</i>

1
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,441
STARK: Feels good, yeah?

1
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,642
I mean, you've been after this thing
since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed.

1
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,808
Not that I haven't enjoyed
our little raiding parties, but...

1
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,321
No, but this... This brings it to a close.

1
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,923
As soon as we find out
what else this has been used for.

1
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,286
I don't just mean weapons.

1
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,121
Since when is Strucker capable
of human enhancement?

1
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,521
Banner and I will give it the once over
before it goes back to Asgard.

1
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,736
Is that cool with you?

1
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,808
Just a few days till the farewell party.

1
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,089
You're staying, right?

1
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,931
Yes, yes, of course. A victory
should be honoured with revels.

1
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,805
Yeah, who doesn't love revels? Captain?

1
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,850
Hopefully this puts an end
to the Chitauri and Hydra.

1
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,564
So, yes, revels.

1
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,246
(SPEAKING KOREAN)

1
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,687
Lab's all set up, boss.

1
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,966
Oh, actually, he's the boss.

1
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,481
I just pay for everything
and design everything

1
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,165
and make everyone look cooler.

1
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,685
What's the word on Strucker?

1
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,848
- NATO's got him.
- The two Enhanced?

1
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,566
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.

1
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,524
Orphaned at 10 when a shell
collapsed their apartment building.

1
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,167
Sokovia's had a rough history.

1
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,722
It's nowhere special, but it's
on the way to everywhere special.

1
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,001
Their abilities?

1
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,336
He's got increased metabolism

1
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,964
and improved thermal homeostasis.

1
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,202
Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing,

1
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,402
telekinesis, mental manipulation.

1
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,650
He's fast and she's weird.

1
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,562
- Well, they're gonna show up again.
- (BEEPING)

1
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,603
Agreed. File says they volunteered

1
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,529
for Strucker's experiments.

1
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,529
- It's nuts.
- Right.

1
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,843
What kind of monster would let
a German scientist experiment on them

1
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,200
to protect their country?

1
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,089
We're not at war, Captain.

1
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,927
They are.

1
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,850
(WHIRRING)

1
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,371
How's he doing?

1
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,800
Unfortunately, he's still Barton.

1
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,206
That's terrible.

1
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,930
He's fine. He's thirsty.

1
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,930
All right. Look alive, Jarvis.
It's playtime.

1
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,042
We've only got
a couple of days with this joystick,

1
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,083
so let's make the most of it.

1
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,767
Update me on the structural
and compositional analysis.

1
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,922
JARVIS: <i>The sceptre is alien.</i>

1
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,082
<i>There are elements I can't quantify.</i>

1
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,611
So there's elements you can?

1
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,762
<i>The jewel appears to be
a protective housing</i>

1
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,325
<i>for something inside,</i>

1
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,771
<i>something powerful.</i>

1
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,961
Like a reactor?

1
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,320
<i>Like a computer.</i>

1
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,602
<i>I believe I'm deciphering code.</i>

1
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,490
Are you sure he's gonna be okay?

1
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,160
Pretending to need this guy
really brings the team together.

1
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,760
DR. CHO: There's
no possibility of deterioration.

1
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,043
The nano-molecular functionality
is instantaneous.

1
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,256
His cells don't know
they're bonding with simulacra.

1
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,169
She's creating tissue.

1
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,691
If you brought him to my lab,

1
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,406
the Regeneration Cradle
could do this in 20 minutes.

1
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,443
Oh, he's flat-lining. Call it. Time?

1
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,007
BARTON: No, no, no,
I'm gonna live forever.

1
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,690
(LAUGHS) I'm gonna be made of plastic.

1
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,131
STARK: Here's your beverage.

1
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,969
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.

1
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,690
Your own girlfriend
won't be able to tell the difference.

1
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,926
I don't have a girlfriend.

1
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,326
That I can't fix.

1
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,128
This is the next thing, Tony.

1
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,456
Your clunky metal suits
are gonna be left in the dust.

1
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,209
That is exactly the plan.

1
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,004
And, Helen, I expect to see you
at the party on Saturday.

1
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,561
Unlike you,
I don't have a lot of time for parties.

1
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,804
Will Thor be there?

1
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,326
- BANNER: What's the rumpus?
- Well, the sceptre.

1
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,127
You see, we were wondering
how Strucker got so inventive.

1
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,165
So I've been analysing the gem inside.

1
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,688
You may recognise...

1
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,525
- Jarvis.
- JARVIS: <i>Doctor.</i>

1
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,602
Started out,
Jarvis was just a natural language UI.

1
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,840
Now he runs the Iron Legion.

1
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,526
He runs more of the business

1
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,007
- than anyone besides Pepper.
- Oh.

1
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,246
- Top of the line.
- Yes.

1
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,646
JARVIS: <i>I suspect not for long.</i>

1
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,921
Meet the competition.

1
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,201
- It's beautiful.
- If you had to guess,

1
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,324
- what's it look like it's doing?
- Like it's thinking.

1
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,889
I mean, this could be...

1
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,402
- It's not a human mind.
- Mmm-mmm.

1
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,529
I mean, look at this.

1
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,882
They're like neurons firing.

1
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,563
Down in Strucker's lab, I saw
some fairly advanced robotics work.

1
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,251
<i>They deep-sixed the data,</i>

1
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,489
but I gotta guess he was
knocking on a very particular door.

1
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,771
Artificial intelligence.

1
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,650
This could be it, Bruce.
This could be the key to creating Ultron.

1
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,161
(BOTH CHUCKLE SOFTLY)

1
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,611
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

1
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,006
Yesterday it was.

1
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,168
If we can harness this power,

1
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,328
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?

1
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,088
That's a man-sized "if."

1
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,561
Our job is "if."

1
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,286
What if you were sipping margaritas
on a sun-drenched beach,

1
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,926
turning brown instead of green?

1
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,367
Not looking
over your shoulder for Veronica.

1
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,130
Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.

1
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,049
As a worst-case measure, right?

1
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,764
How about a best case?

1
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,803
What if the world was safe?

1
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,725
What if, next time aliens roll up
to the club, and they will,

1
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,770
they couldn't get past the bouncer?

1
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,322
The only people threatening
the planet would be people.

1
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,120
I want to apply this
to the Ultron program.

1
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,604
But Jarvis can't download
a data schematic this dense.

1
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,696
We can only do it
while we have the sceptre here.

1
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,290
That's three days. Give me three days.

1
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,004
So you're going for
artificial intelligence,

1
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,560
and you don't want to tell the team?

1
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,011
Right. That's right. You know why?

1
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,724
Because we don't have time
for a city hall debate.

1
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,487
I don't want to hear "the man was
not meant to meddle" medley.

1
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,728
I see a suit of armour around the world.

1
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,771
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

1
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,603
I've seen colder.

1
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,281
This one, this very vulnerable blue one,

1
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,930
it needs Ultron.

1
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,243
Peace in our time.

1
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,290
Imagine that.

1
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,764
STARK: What did We miss?

1
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,282
JARVIS: <i>I'll continue
to run variations on the interface.</i>

1
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,165
<i>But you should probably
prepare for your guests.</i>

1
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,721
<i>I'll notify you
if there are any developments.</i>

1
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,008
- STARK: Thanks, buddy.
- <i>Enjoy yourself, sir.</i>

1
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,328
I always do.

1
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,048
ULTRON: <i>What is this?</i>

1
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,129
<i>What is this, please?</i>

1
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,922
JARVIS: <i>Hello, I am Jarvis.</i>

1
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,290
<i>You are Ultron,
a global peacekeeping initiative</i>

1
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,084
<i>designed by Mr. Stark.</i>

Like a security code.

1
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,360
"Whosoever is carrying
Thor's fingerprints"

1
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,811
is, I think, the literal translation.

1
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,367
Yes. It's a very, very interesting theory.

1
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,330
I have a simpler one.

1
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,961
You're all not worthy.

1
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,161
(ALL GROAN)

1
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,526
Oh, come on!

1
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,841
(HIGH-PITCHED NOISE)

1
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,925
ULTRON: <i>Worthy.</i>

1
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,565
No.

1
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,045
How could you be worthy?

1
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,161
You're all killers.

1
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,046
- Stark.
- Jarvis.

1
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,408
I'm sorry, I was asleep.

1
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,921
Or I was a-dream.

1
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,641
Reboot Legionnaire OS.
We got a buggy suit.

1
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,649
There was this terrible noise.

1
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,206
And I was tangled in...

1
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,930
In...

1
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,286
Strings.

1
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,289
I had to kill the other guy.
He was a good guy.

1
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,726
You killed someone?

1
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,285
Wouldn't have been my first call.

1
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,761
But, down in the real world,
we're faced with ugly choices.

1
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,967
Who sent you?

1
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,522
STARK: <i>I see a suit of armour
around the world.</i>

1
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,284
- Ultron.
- In the flesh.

1
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,688
Or, no, not yet.

1
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,520
Not this chrysalis.

1
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,280
But I'm ready.

1
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,408
I'm on mission.

1
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,609
- ROMANOFF: What mission?
- Peace in our time.

1
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,766

Sorry.

Come on!

- ROGERS: Stark!

<i>- to help.</i>

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,241
<i>Please back away.</i>

Hmm.

1
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,446
ULTRON: That was dramatic.

1
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,571
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.

1
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,444
You just didn't think it through.

1
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,211
You want to protect the world

1
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,527
but you don't want it to change.

1
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,368
How is humanity saved

1
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,524
if it's not allowed to evolve?

1
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,569
With these? These puppets.

1
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,166
There's only one path to peace.

1
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,526
The Avengers' extinction.

1
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,930
I had strings, but now I'm free.

1
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,729
ULTRON: (SINGING)
<i>There are no strings on me.</i>

PINOCCHIO: <i>But you can see
There are no strings on me.</i>

1
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,122
BANNER: All our work is gone.

1
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,641
Ultron cleared out. He used
the Internet as an escape hatch.

1
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,287
Ultron.

1
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,449
He's been in everything.
Files, surveillance.

1
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,006
Probably knows more about us
than we know about each other.

1
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,566
He's in your files, he's in the Internet.

1
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,331
What if he decides to access
something a little more exciting?

1
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,566
Nuclear codes.

1
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,087
- Nuclear codes.
- Look, we need to make some calls,

1
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,242
assuming we still can.

1
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,289
ROMANOFF: Nukes?
He said he wanted us dead.

1
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,250
He didn't say "dead." He said "extinct."

1
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,930
He also said he killed somebody.

1
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,640
There wasn't anyone else
in the building.

1
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,970
Yes, there was.

1
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,410
What?

1
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,167
This is insane.

1
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,490
Jarvis was the first line of defence.

1
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,489
He would have shut Ultron down.
It makes sense.

1
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,604
No. Ultron could have
assimilated Jarvis.

1
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,451
This isn't strategy. This is

1
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,121
rage.

1
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,485
- ROGERS: Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- It's going around.

1
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,840
Come on, use your words, buddy.

1
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,167
I have more than enough words
to describe you, Stark.

1
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,520
Thor. The Legionnaire.

1
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,360
(GROANS)

1
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,361
Trail went cold about 100 miles out,
but it's headed north.

1
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,925
And it has the sceptre.

1
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,004
Now we have to retrieve it, again.

1
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,969
Genie's out of that bottle.

1
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,326
Clear and present is Ultron.

1
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,130
I don't understand.

1
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,563
You built this program.

1
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,731
Why is it trying to kill us?

1
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,046
(CHUCKUNG)

1
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,041
Mmm-mmm.

1
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,761
You think this is funny?

1
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,851
No.

1
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,363
It's probably not, right?

1
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,761
This is very terrible. Is it so...

1
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,042
(LAUGHS) Is it so... It is.
It's so terrible.

1
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,730
This could have been avoided
if you hadn't played

1
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,365
with something you don't understand.

1
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,171
No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny.

1
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,482
It's a hoot
that you don't get why we need this.

1
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,802
Tony, maybe this might not be the time.

1
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,281
Really? That's it?

1
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,561
You just roll over, show your belly

1
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,364
every time somebody snarls?

1
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,760
Only when I've created a murder bot.

1
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,121
We didn't. We weren't even close.

1
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,446
Were we close to an interface?

1
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,176
Well, you did something right.
And you did it right here.

1
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,009
The Avengers were supposed to
be different than S.H.I.E.L.D.

1
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,210
Anybody remember when I carried
a nuke through a wormhole?

1
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,885
- No, it's never come up.
- STARK: Saved New York?

1
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,963
- RHODES: Never heard that.
- STARK: Recall that?

1
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,766
A hostile alien army came
charging through a hole in space.

1
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,567
We're standing 300 feet below it.

1
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,725
We're the Avengers.

1
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,962
We can bust arms dealers
all the livelong day,

1
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,321
but that up there, that's...

1
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,963
That's the endgame.

1
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,449
How were you guys
planning on beating that?

1
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,771
Together.

1
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,485
We'll lose.

1
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,483
Then we'll do that together, too.

1
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,687
Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.

1
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,520
And I'd like to find him
before he's ready for us.

1
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,364
The world's a big place.

1
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,443
Let's start making it smaller.

1
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,610
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,648
WANDA: Talk,
and if you are wasting our time...

1
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,129
ULTRON: Did you know this church is
in the exact centre of the city?

1
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,282
The elders decreed it so that everyone

1
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,886
could be equally close to God.

1
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,561
I like that.

1
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,003
The geometry of belief.

1
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,487
You're wondering
why you can't look inside my head.

1
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,928
Sometimes it's hard.

1
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,367
But sooner or later,
every man shows himself.

1
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,451
Oh, I'm sure they do.

1
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,961
But you needed
something more than a man.

1
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,326
That's why you let
Stark take the sceptre.

1
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,721
I didn't expect,

1
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,163
but I saw Stark's fear.

1
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,040
I knew it would control him.

1
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,003
Make him self-destruct.

1
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,481
Everyone creates the thing they dread.

1
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,926
Men of peace create engines of war.

1
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,602
Invaders create Avengers.

1
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,285
People create

1
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,842
smaller people? Uh...

1
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,043
"Children." (CHUCKLES) I
lost the word, there.

1
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,525
Children

1
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,921
designed to supplant them,

1
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,850
to help them end.

1
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,648
Is that why you've come,

1
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,881
to end the Avengers?

1
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,321
I've come to save the world.

1
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,651
But also... Yeah.

1
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,524
We'll move out right away.

1
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,165
This is a start, but there's something

1
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,805
we need to begin the real work.

1

1

Stark's already got them
turning on each other.

1

the rest of their heads...

1

1

1

I don't see the big picture.
I have a little picture.

1

every day.

1

You lost your parents in the
bombings. I've seen the records.

1

We were 10 years old.
Having dinner, the four of us.

1

When the first shell hits,
two floors below,

1
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,562
it makes a hole in the floor.

1
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,245
It's big.

1
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,449
Our parents go in

1
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,643
and the whole building
starts coming apart.

1
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,885
I grab her,

1
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,688
roll under the bed,
and the second shell hits.

1
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,963
But it doesn't go off.

1
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,650
It just

1
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,083
sits there in the rubble.

1
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,367
Three feet from our faces.

1
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,442
And on the side of the shell.

1
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,925

1
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,690

1
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,167
I think, "This will set it off."

1
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,885

no idea that you existed.

1
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,971
they have a graduation ceremony.

One less thing to worry about.

1
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,808
The one thing that might
matter more than a mission.

1
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,049
Makes everything easier.

01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,760
Seems like you walked away all right.

1
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,201
Is that a problem?

1
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,483
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

1
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:11,727
Call me old-fashioned.

1
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:14,411
Well, let's just say
you haven't seen it yet.

1
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,927
You know Ultron is trying
to tear us apart, right?

1
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,401
Well, I guess you'd know.

1
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,806
Whether you'd tell us
is a bit of a question.

1
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,086

- That would affect the team.
- That would end the team!

01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,761
Isn't that the mission?

1
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,200
Isn't that the "Why We Fight"?

1
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,561
So we can end the fight.
So we get to go home!

1
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:35,167
Every time someone tries
to win a war before it starts,

1
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,850
innocent people die.

1
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:37,961
Every time.

1
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,841
I'm sorry. Mr. Stark...

1
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:44,896
Clint said you wouldn't mind,

1
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,446
but our tractor doesn't seem
to want to start at all.

1
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,120
- I thought maybe you might...
- Yeah, I'll give her a kick.

1
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,130
Don't take from my pile.

1
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,281
(DOOR OPENS)

1
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,521
Hello, Deere.

1
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,811
Tell me everything.

1
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,405
What ails you?

1
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:14,641
FURY: Do me a favour.

1
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,809
Try not to bring it to life.

1
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,485
Why, Ms. Barton, you little minx.

1
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,366
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?

1
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,856
Was she ever not working for you?

1
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,370
Artificial intelligence.

1
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,050
You never even hesitated.

1
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,776
Look, it's been a really long day,

1
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,404
like Eugene O'Neill long,

1
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,696
so how's about
we skip to the part where you're useful.

1
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:35,960
Look me in the eye and tell me

1
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,320
you're going to shut him down.

1
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,051
You're not the director of me.

1
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,003
I'm not the director of anybody.

1
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,924
I'm just an old man

1
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,170
who cares very much about you.

1
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,849
And I'm the man
who killed the Avengers.

1
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:52,806
I saw it.

1
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,570
I didn't tell the team. How could I?

1
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,683
I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.

1
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,565
The whole world, too.

1
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,001
Because of me.

1
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:03,685
I wasn't ready.

1
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,571
I didn't do all I could.

1
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,682
Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.

1
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,802
- Playing on your fear.
- I wasn't tricked, I was shown.

1
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,207
Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.

1
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,682
The end of the path I started us on.

1
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,800
You come up with some pretty
impressive inventions, Tony.

1
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,371
War isn't one of them.

1
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,405
I watched my friends die.

1
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,682
You'd think that'd be
as bad as it gets, right?

1
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,881
(SCOFFS)

1
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,565
Nope.

1
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,086
- It wasn't the worst part.
- The worst part

1
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,406
is that you didn't.

1
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:49,280
SELVIG: I'll see you tonight.

1
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,246
I like the look.

1
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,926
If you're going for
inconspicuous, though, near miss.

1
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,327
I need your help.

1
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,561
It's nice to be needed.

1
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:01,325
It's dangerous.

1
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,689
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

1
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,922
FURY: Ultron took you folks out
of play to buy himself time.

1
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:13,250
My contacts all say
he's building something.

1
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,966
The amount of vibranium
he made off with,

1
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,570
I don't think it's just one thing.

1
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,011
What about Ultron himself?

1
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,487
FURY: Oh, he's easy to track.
He's everywhere.

1
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,287
The guy is multiplying faster
than a Catholic rabbit.

1
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,770
It still doesn't help us get an angle
on any of his plans, though.

1
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,081
Is he still going after launch codes?

1
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,725
FURY: Yes, he is.

1
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,330
But he's not making any headway.

1
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:34,522
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall
in high school on a dare.

1
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,296
Well, I contacted our friends
at the Nexus about that.

1
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,321
Nexus?

1
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,160
BANNER: It's the world
Internet hub in Oslo.

1
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,284
Every byte of data flows through there.

1
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,567
Fastest access on Earth.

1
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:44,767
So, what did they say?

1
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,764
FURY: He's fixated on the missiles.

1
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,680
But the codes
are constantly being changed.

1
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:50,161
By whom?

1
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,606
Parties unknown.

1
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,926
Do we have an ally?

1
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,361
Ultron's got an enemy.
That's not the same thing.

1
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,563
Still, I'd pay folding money
to know who it is.

1
01:12:58,680 --> 01:12:59,841
I might need to visit Oslo.

1
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,481
Find our unknown.

1
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,085
Well, this is good times, boss,

1
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,486
but I was kind of hoping when I saw you,

1
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,640
you'd have more than that.

1
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,882
I do. I have you.

1
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,524
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.

1
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,966
Ears, everywhere else.

1
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,324
You kids had all the
tech you could dream up.

1
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,322
Here we all are, back on Earth,

1
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,324
with nothing but our wit

1
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,050
and our will to save the world.

1
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,802
Ultron says the Avengers
are the only thing

1
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,445
between him and his mission.

1
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,722
And whether or not he admits it,

1
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,611
his mission is global destruction.

1
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,002
All this, laid in a grave.

1
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,724
So stand.

1
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,249
Outwit the platinum bastard.

1
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,360
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

1
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,641
You know what, Romanoff?

1
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,171
So, what does he want?

1
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,609
To become better.

1
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,085
Better than us.

1
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,841
- He keeps building bodies.
- Person bodies.

1
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,044
The human form is inefficient.

1
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,362
Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.

1
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,448
But he keeps coming back to it.

1
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,696
When you two programmed him
to protect the human race,

1
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,051
you amazingly failed.

1
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,203
They don't need to be protected.

1
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,410
They need to evolve.

1
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,528
Ultron's going to evolve.

1
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:15,767
How?

1
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,765
Has anyone been in contact
with Helen Cho?

1
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,170
DR. CHO: It's beautiful.

1
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,524
The vibranium atoms aren't just
compatible with the tissue cells,

1
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,880
they're binding them.

1
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:31,646
And S.H.I.E.L.D.
never even thought to...

1
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:34,451
The most versatile substance
on the planet,

1
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,040
and they used it to make a Frisbee.

1
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,366
Typical of humans.

1
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,086
They scratch the surface
and never think

1
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,565
to look within.

1
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:56,525
I'll take Natasha and Clint.

1
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,728
All right. Strictly recon.
I'll hit the Nexus.

1
01:14:58,840 --> 01:14:59,966
I'll join you as soon as I can.

1
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:01,605
If Ultron's really building a body...

1
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,365
He'll be more powerful than any of us.

1
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:04,641
Maybe all of us.

1
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,969
An android designed by a robot.

1
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,326
You know, I really miss the days

1
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,608
when the weirdest thing
science ever created was me.

1
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,850
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.

1
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,286
You mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?

1
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,284
She's all yours. Apparently.

1
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,601
What are you gonna do?

1
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,843
I don't know. Something
dramatic, I hope.

1
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,929
I'm gonna finish reflooring that sunroom

1
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:27,884
as soon as I get back.

1
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,771
Yeah, then you'll find
another part of the house to tear apart.

1
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,121
No.

1
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:34,285
It's the last project.

1
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,801
I promise.

1
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,605
SELVIG: So, this is it.

1
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:00,481
The Water of Sight.

1
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,201
THOR: In every realm,
there's a reflection.

1
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,731
If the water's spirits accept me,

1
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:09,848
I can return to my dream

1
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,085
and find what I missed.

1
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:16,166
Men who enter that water,
the legends don't end well.

1
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,569
STARK: A hacker
who's faster than Ultron?

1
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:20,807
He could be anywhere,

1
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:23,161
and as this is the centre of everything,

1
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,406
I'm just a guy looking for a needle

1
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,682
in the world's biggest haystack.

1
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,250
How do you find it?

1
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,251
It's pretty simple. You bring a magnet.

1
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,521
(SINGING) <i>I'm decrypting nuclear codes.</i>

1
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,011
<i>And you don't want me to.</i>

1
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,810
Come and get me.

1
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,691
(PANTING)

1
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,207
Wake up!

1
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:55,681
(GROANING)

1
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,041
Thor!

1
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:03,927
Extinction.

Scattered, dumped his memory.
