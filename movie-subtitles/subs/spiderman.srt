1
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,949
Things are never gonna be the same now.

2
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,163
I mean, look at this.

3
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,374
You got aliens.

4
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,781
You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.

5
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:54,257
When I was a kid,
I used to draw cowboys and Indians.

6
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,968
Actually, it's Native American, but whatever.

7
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,930
Yeah. Tell you what, though.

8
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,519
It ain't bad, is it?

9
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,430
No. Yeah.

10
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,473
Kid's got a future.

11
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,438
Yeah, well...

12
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,736
...we'll see, I guess.

13
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,504
No, hey!

14
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,097
You can't saw through that stuff.

15
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,096
These alien bastards are tough.

16
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,227
You gotta use the stuff they use.

17
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,225
- See? All right.
- All right.

18
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,728
Oh, hey!

19
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,189
Glad you could join us. Afternoon.

20
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,608
- Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.
- Yeah, your alarm.

21
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,493
Look, just go stack
that armor plating like I asked you.

22
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,450
This is a huge deal for us.

23
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,081
Attention, please!

24
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,084
In accordance with Executive Order 396B...

25
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:11,792
...all post-battle cleanup operations
are now under our jurisdiction.

26
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,048
Thank you for your service.
We'll take it from here.

27
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,503
Who the hell are you?

28
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,134
Qualified personnel.

29
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:21,639
Look, I have a city contract to salvage
all this, okay, with the city, so...

30
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:26,394
I apologize, Mr. Toomes, but all salvage
operations are now under our jurisdiction.

31
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,852
Please turn over any and all
exotic materials that you've collected...

32
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,357
...or you will be prosecuted.

33
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,476
Ma'am, what am...

34
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,522
Please. Come here. Hey, lady, come on.

35
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,280
Look...

36
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,946
...I bought trucks for this job.

37
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,485
I brought in a whole new crew.

38
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,155
These guys have a family. I have a family.

39
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,449
I'm all in on this. I could lose my house.

40
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,960
I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.

41
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,246
Maybe next time, don't overextend yourself.

42
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,461
What'd you say?

43
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,011
Yeah.

44
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,843
He's right. I overextended myself.

45
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,679
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Don't do it.

46
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,344
Put them down.

47
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,433
If you have a grievance,
you may take it up with my superiors.

48
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,402
Your superiors. Who the hell are they?

49
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,188
A joint venture between Stark Industries
and the government...

50
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,949
...the Department of Damage Control,
will oversee the collection...

51
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,157
...and storage of alien
and other exotic materials.

52
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,118
Now the assholes who made this mess
are paid to clean it up.

53
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,532
Yeah, it's all rigged.

54
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,294
Experts estimate there are
over 1500 tons of exotic material...

55
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,455
...scattered throughout the tri-state area.

56
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,294
Hey, chief!

57
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,960
We have another load from yesterday.
We're supposed to turn this in, right?

58
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,174
I ain't hauling it.

59
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,554
It's too bad.

60
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,637
We could have made some cool stuff
from all that alien junk.

61
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,936
I tell you what.

62
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,180
Let's keep it.

63
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,355
The world's changing.

64
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,948
It's time we change, too.

65
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,157
There you go, Mason.

66
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,168
Business is good.

67
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,294
New York. Queens.

68
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,922
- It's a rough borough, but, hey, it's home.
- Who you talking to?

69
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:44,254
No one. Just making
a little video of the trip.

70
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,840
- You know you can't show it to anyone.
- Yeah, I know.

71
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,845
Then why are you narrating in that voice?

72
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,598
- Because it's fun.
- Fun.

73
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,761
So why do they call you Happy?

74
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,607
Come on.
I'm not carrying your bags. Let's go.

75
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,688
Hey, should I go to the bathroom before?

76
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,023
There's a bathroom on it.

77
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,320
No pilot? That's awesome.

78
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,069
- Is that where you're gonna sit?
- Yeah.

79
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,235
This is your first time on a private plane?

80
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,948
My first time on any plane.

81
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,865
Should it... Should it be...
Should it be making that noise?

82
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,840
No one has actually told me
why I'm in Berlin or what I'm doing.

83
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,222
Something about Captain America going crazy.

84
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,178
- This is you.
- Oh, we're neighbors?

85
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,434
We're not roommates. Suit up.

86
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:36,936
Okay, Peter, you got this.

87
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,189
- What the hell are you wearing?
- It's my suit.

88
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,145
- Where's the case?
- What case?

89
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,901
What? I thought that was a closet.

90
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,311
- This is still my room?
- Go.

91
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,275
- My room is way bigger than...
- There.

92
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,190
I found the case. I found the case.

93
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,943
"A minor upgrade"?

94
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,029
Oh, my God.

95
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,413
- Put it on.
- What the...

96
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,495
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen...

97
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,001
- Let's go.
- But, yeah. Well, I don't understand.

98
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,538
Is it for me? Happy. Happy, wait.

99
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,586
This is insane. Insane.

100
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,877
Look at this thing. Look. Look at the eyes.

101
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,341
- This is the greatest day of my life.
- Let's go.

102
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:15,633
Okay, there's Captain America, Iron Man,
Black Widow. Who's that new guy?

103
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,974
- Underoos!
- Oh, that's me. I gotta go. I gotta go.

104
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,939
Hey, everyone.

105
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,854
The craziest thing just happened.

106
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:28,692
I just had a fight with Captain America.
I stole his shield. I threw it at him...

107
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,029
What the hell? He's big now.
I gotta go. Hang on.

108
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,538
It was the most amazing thing!
Mr. Stark was like, "Hey, Underoos!"

109
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:41,041
I flipped in and stole Cap's shield.
I was like, "What's up, everybody?"

110
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,827
And then... Hey, just a second!

111
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,711
Coming!

112
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,293
Hey.

113
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,250
We have thin walls here.

114
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,217
What are you doing, a little video diary?

115
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,181
- Yeah.
- It's all right.

116
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,886
- I'd do the same thing.
- I told him not to.

117
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,222
- He was filming. I'm gonna wipe the chip.
- Okay.

118
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,432
Hey. You know what?

119
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,939
We should make an alibi video
for your aunt anyway. You ready?

120
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,522
- An alibi? Sure. Okay.
- We rolling? Get in the frame.

121
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:10,405
Hey, May. How you doing? What are
you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.

122
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,112
Peter, that's inappropriate.
Let's start over. You can edit it.

123
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,197
Three, two, one. Hey, May.

124
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:21,867
My gosh, I wanted to tell you what
an incredible job your nephew did...

125
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,912
...this weekend
at the Stark internship retreat.

126
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,705
Everyone was impressed.

127
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,999
Come on! It's a freaking merge. I'm sorry.

128
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,712
This is because you're not
on Queens Boulevard.

129
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,879
See, Happy is hoping to get
bumped up to asset management.

130
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,673
He was forehead of security,
before that he was a driver.

131
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,808
That was a private conversation.

132
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,345
I don't like joking about this.
It was hard to talk about that.

133
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,981
- No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?
- Here we are. End of the line.

134
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,315
- Can you give us a moment?
- Want me to leave?

135
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,945
Grab Peter's case out of the trunk.

136
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,152
I can keep the suit?

137
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,409
Yes, we were just talking about it.

138
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,581
Do me a favor, though.
Happy's kind of your point guy on this.

139
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,912
Don't stress him out.
Don't do anything stupid.

140
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,997
I've seen his cardiogram.

141
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,753
- All right?
- Yes.

142
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:11,290
Don't do anything I would do,
and don't do anything I wouldn't do.

143
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,427
There's a little gray area in there.
That's where you operate.

144
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,713
- Wait, does that mean I'm an Avenger?
- No.

145
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,965
- This it?
- Seventh floor.

146
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,555
- I can take that. You don't have to.
- You'll take it?

147
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,095
- Yeah, I can take that.
- Thank you.

148
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,058
So when's our next...
When's our next "retreat," you know?

149
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,851
- What, next mission?
- Yeah, the mission. The missions.

150
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,861
- We'll call you.
- Do you have my numbers?

151
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,238
No, I mean, we'll call you.

152
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,565
Like, someone will call you. All right?

153
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,985
- From your team.
- Okay. All right.

154
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,997
It's not a hug. I'm just grabbing
the door for you. We're not there yet.

155
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,708
Bye.

156
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,628
They're gonna call me.

157
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,717
What's up, Penis Parker?

158
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,435
Rise and shine,
Midtown Science and Technology.

159
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,565
Don't forget about your homecoming tickets.

160
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,351
Do you have a date for homecoming?

161
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,646
Thanks, Jason, but I already have a date.

162
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,780
- Okay.
- Yeah.

163
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:08,540
Damn it. You, in my office right now.

164
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,477
Join me, and together...

165
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,934
...we'll build my new LEGO Death Star.

166
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,858
- What?
- So lame.

167
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,610
That's awesome. How many pieces?

168
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,611
Three thousand eight hundred and three.

169
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,024
- That's insane.
- I know. You want to build it tonight?

170
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,114
No, I can't tonight. I've got the Stark...

171
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,949
- Stark internship.
- Yeah, exactly.

172
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,363
Always got that internship.

173
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,453
Yeah, well, hopefully,
soon it'll lead to a real job with them.

174
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,118
- That would be so sweet.
- Right?

175
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,662
He'd be all, "Good job
on those spreadsheets, Peter.

176
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,501
Here's a gold coin."

177
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,175
- I don't know how jobs work.
- That's exactly how they work.

178
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,049
I'll knock out the bones of the Death Star.

179
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:07,137
I'll come by afterwards. For the most part,
the difficult thing is the base of it.

180
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,644
The top half we can knock out
in two hours, tops.

181
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,814
That'd be great.

182
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,315
I'm gonna be late.

183
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,818
Okay, so how do we calculate
linear acceleration...

184
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,071
...between points A and B?

185
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,277
Flash.

186
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,488
It's the product of sine of the angle
and gravity divided by mass.

187
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,951
Nope. Peter. You still with us?

188
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,374
Yeah, yeah.

189
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,871
Mass cancels out,
so it's just gravity times sine.

190
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:40,917
Right. See, Flash, being the fastest
isn't always the best if you are wrong.

191
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,710
You're dead.

192
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:50,385
Today we're talking
about Danish physicist Niels Bohr...

193
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,220
...but trust me, there's nothing Bohr-ing...

194
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,682
...about his discoveries
regarding quantum theory.

195
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,702
Did Liz get a new top?

196
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,615
No. We've seen that before,
but never with that skirt.

197
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,626
- Liz, hey. That looks so good.
- Hi!

198
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,412
We should probably stop staring
before it gets creepy.

199
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,830
Too late.

200
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,669
You guys are losers.

201
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,043
Well, then why do you sit with us?

202
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,756
Because I don't have any friends.

203
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,764
Next question.

204
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,426
What is the heaviest
naturally-occurring element?

205
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,682
Hydrogen's the lightest.

206
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,313
That's not the question. Okay.

207
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,689
- Yeah.
- Uranium.

208
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,941
Correct. Thank you, Abraham.

209
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,148
- Yes.
- Please open your books to page 10.

210
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,530
Peter, it's nationals.

211
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,907
Is there no way
you could take one weekend off?

212
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:51,036
I can't go to Washington. If Mr. Stark
needs me, I have to make sure I'm here.

213
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,572
You've never been
in the same room as Tony Stark.

214
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,991
Wait. What's happening?

215
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,125
- Peter's not going to Washington.
- No.

216
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,457
- No, no, no.
- Why not?

217
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,337
Really? Right before nationals?

218
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,170
He already quit marching band
and robotics lab.

219
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,590
I'm not obsessed with him.
Just very observant.

220
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,009
Flash, you're in for Peter.

221
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,300
I don't know.
I gotta check my calendar first.

222
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,685
I got a hot date with Black Widow coming up.

223
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,641
That is false.

224
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:20,182
What'd I tell you about using the bell
for comedic purposes?

225
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,576
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, man.

226
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,874
What's up, Mr. Delmar?

227
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,584
Hey, Mr. Parker.

228
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:44,965
Number five, right?

229
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,627
Yeah, and with pickles, and can you
smush it down real flat? Thanks.

230
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,262
You got it, boss.

231
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,967
How's your aunt?

232
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,633
Yeah, she's all right.

233
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,348
She's a very hot Italian woman.

234
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,555
How's your daughter?

235
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,185
- Ten dollars.
- It's 5 dollars.

236
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:08,072
- For that comment, 10 dollars.
- Hey, come on. I'm joking. I'm joking.

237
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,570
Here's 5 dollars.

238
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,239
What's up, Murph?

239
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,362
How you doing, buddy?

240
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,620
So how's school?

241
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,750
It's boring. Got better things to do.

242
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,163
Stay in school, kid.
Otherwise, you're gonna end up like me.

243
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,883
- This is great.
- Best sandwiches in Queens.

244
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,574
Finally.

245
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,082
- What's the matter with you?
- Could you hold this?

246
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,587
Thanks.

247
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,925
Hey, is this anybody's bike? No?

248
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,507
- Hey, buddy, is this your bike?
- I have no change.

249
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,967
Does anyone have a pen? Do you have a pen?

250
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,428
Everybody good?

251
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,775
Hey!

252
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,730
You're that spider guy on YouTube, right?

253
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:13,943
Call me Spider-Man.

254
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,608
Okay, Spider-Man. Do a flip.

255
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,328
- Yeah!
- Not bad.

256
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,168
Hey, buddy.

257
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,388
- Shouldn't steal cars, it's bad.
- It's my car, dumbass!

258
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,265
Hey! Shut that off!

259
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,471
- Can you tell him it's my car?
- I was...

260
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,183
- I work at nights. Come on.
- That's not your car!

261
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,473
- That's his car.
- How was I supposed to know?

262
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,017
- He was putting that in the window!
- Every day with these alarms!

263
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,028
- Turn it off!
- Don't make me come down there, punk.

264
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,860
Hey, Gary. How you doing?

265
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,366
Marjorie, how are you? How's your mother?

266
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,746
I'm good, I'm good.

267
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,373
You have reached the voicemail box of:

268
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,004
Happy Hogan.

269
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,381
Hey, Happy. Here's my report for tonight.

270
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,042
I stopped a grand theft bicycle.

271
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,757
Couldn't find the owner,
so I just left a note.

272
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,218
I helped this lost, old Dominican lady.

273
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,260
She was really nice and bought me a churro.

274
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,603
I just feel like I could be doing more.

275
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,982
You know? Just curious
when the next real mission's gonna be.

276
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,439
So, yeah, just call me back.

277
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,356
It's Peter. Parker.

278
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,745
Why would I tell him about the churro?

279
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,992
Hey, hey.

280
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,831
Okay.

281
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:59,087
- Can't wait to see this thing.
- Finally, something good.

282
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,842
Yo, this high-tech stuff makes it too easy.

283
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,853
- Told you it was worth it.
- Okay, go, go, go.

284
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,725
Oh, nice.

285
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,737
We can hit, like, five more places tonight.

286
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,455
What's up, guys? You forget your PIN number?

287
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:31,914
You're the Avengers.

288
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,996
What are you guys doing here?

289
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,754
Thor. Hulk. Good to finally meet you guys.

290
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,421
I thought you'd be more handsome
in person. Iron Man.

291
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,511
Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank?
You're a billionaire.

292
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,348
Hey...

293
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,514
Oh, this feels so weird.

294
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,608
What is that thing?

295
00:19:55,778 --> 00:20:00,022
I'm starting to think
you're not the Avengers.

296
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,735
911. What's your emergency?

297
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:10,499
Spider-Man is fighting the Avengers
in a bank on 21st Street.

298
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,500
Let's wrap this up. It's a school night.

299
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,044
So how do jerks like you get tech like this?

300
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,003
No. Wait, wait, wait!

301
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,433
Mr. Delmar.

302
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,847
Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in here?
Is anybody in here? Hello?

303
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,816
Oh, come on.

304
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,244
I gotta...

305
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,865
- Here, here.
- Good, yeah.

306
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,326
Okay. Good. Yes.

307
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,914
Yes... No. No, put that down.

308
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,206
That's worth more than you or me. Yeah?

309
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,467
The craziest thing just happened.
These guys were robbing an ATM...

310
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,844
- ...with high-tech weapons...
- Take a breath. I don't have time...

311
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,880
- ...for ATM robberies...
- Yeah, but...

312
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:10,300
...or the notes you leave.
I have moving day to worry about.

313
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,185
Everything's gotta be out next week.

314
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,973
- Wait. You're moving? Who's moving?
- Yeah, don't you watch the news?

315
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,439
Tony sold Avengers Tower.
We're relocating to a new facility upstate...

316
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,821
- ...where hopefully cell service is worse.
- But what about me?

317
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,735
What about you?

318
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,947
Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me
or something big goes down?

319
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:31,572
- Can I please talk to Mr. Stark?
- Stay away from anything dangerous.

320
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,492
I'm responsible for making sure
you're responsible, okay?

321
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,875
I am responsible. I... Oh, crap.

322
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,461
- My backpack's gone.
- That doesn't sound responsible.

323
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,627
- I'll call you back.
- Feel free not to.

324
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,771
What was that?

325
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,323
It's nothing. Nothing.

326
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,200
You're the Spider-Man.

327
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,204
- From YouTube.
- I'm not. I'm not.

328
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,660
- You were on the ceiling.
- No. What are you doing in my room?

329
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,746
May let me in.
We were gonna finish the Death Star.

330
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,127
You can't just bust into my room!

331
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,005
That turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster.

332
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,791
Let's go to dinner. Thai? Ned, you want Thai?

333
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,210
- Yes.
- No. He's got a thing.

334
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,970
A thing to do after.

335
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,010
Okay.

336
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,846
Maybe put on some clothes.

337
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,346
- Oh, she doesn't know?
- Nobody knows.

338
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,765
Mr. Stark knows
because he made my suit. That's it.

339
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:25,151
Tony Stark made you that? Are you an Avenger?

340
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,904
Yeah, basically.

341
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,359
You can't tell anybody about this.
You gotta keep it a secret.

342
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,368
- Secret? Why?
- You know what she's like.

343
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,531
If she finds out people try and kill me
every night, she won't let me do this.

344
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,915
Come on, Ned, please.

345
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,791
Okay, okay, okay.

346
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,669
I'll level with you.
I can't keep this a secret.

347
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,580
It's the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

348
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:48,421
Ned, May cannot know.
I cannot do that to her right now.

349
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:52,338
You know? I mean, everything
that's happened with her, I... Please.

350
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,388
- Okay.
- Just swear it, okay?

351
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:58,889
I swear.

352
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,100
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

353
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,185
I can't believe this is happening now.

354
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,600
- Can I try the suit on?
- No.

355
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,609
How's it work? Magnets?
How do you shoot the strings?

356
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,987
- I'm gonna tell you at school tomorrow.
- Great.

357
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,113
Okay, well, wait, then.

358
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,776
How do you do this and the Stark internship?

359
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,033
This is the Stark internship.

360
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,248
Just get out of here.

361
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,461
What's the matter?

362
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,539
Thought you loved larb.

363
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,879
It's too larby?

364
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,760
Not larby enough.

365
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:37,516
How many times do I have to say "larb"
before you talk to me?

366
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,847
You know I larb you.

367
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,058
I'm just stressed.
The internship, and I'm tired.

368
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,268
A lot of work.

369
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,683
The Stark internship.

370
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,524
I have to tell you,
not a fan of that Tony Stark.

371
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:54,900
You're distracted all the time.
He's got you in your head.

372
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:58,161
- Delmar's Sandwiches was destroyed...
- What does he have you doing?

373
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,912
- ...in an explosion...
- You need to use your instincts.

374
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:03,200
...after an A TM robbery was thwarted
by Queens' own crime stopper...

375
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:04,458
What?

376
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,164
...the Spider-Man.

377
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,671
As the Spider-Man attempted
to foil their heist...

378
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:12,505
...a powerful blast was set off, slicing
through the bodega across the street.

379
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,715
Miraculously, no one was harmed.

380
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:18,973
If you spot something like that happening,
you turn and you run the other way.

381
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,884
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.

382
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,347
Six blocks away from us.

383
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,513
I need a new backpack.

384
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,141
- What?
- I need a new backpack.

385
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,817
That's five.

386
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,363
- Sticky rice pudding.
- We didn't order that.

387
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,364
It's on the house.

388
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,404
Thanks.

389
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,454
That's nice of him.

390
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,206
I think he larbs you.

391
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,335
You got bit by a spider?

392
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,961
Can it bite me?

393
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,963
Well, it probably would've hurt, right?

394
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,420
Whatever. Even if it did hurt,
I'd let it bite me.

395
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,176
Maybe. How much did it hurt?

396
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,553
The spider's dead, Ned.

397
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,897
You were here?

398
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,016
Yeah.

399
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,811
You could've died.

400
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,193
Do you lay eggs?

401
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,074
What? No.

402
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:24,285
- Can you spit venom?
- No.

403
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,745
Can you summon an army of spiders?

404
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,000
No, Ned.

405
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,083
The Sokovia Accords were put into place...

406
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,543
How far can you shoot your webs?

407
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,924
It's unknown. Shut up.

408
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,335
...to begin regulating...

409
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,845
If I was you, I would stand on a building...

410
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:42,382
- ...and just shoot it as far as I could...
- Shut up, Ned.

411
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,428
Hi. I'm Captain America. Whether you're
in the classroom or on the battlefield...

412
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,267
- Do you know him too?
- Yeah, we met.

413
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,897
...fitness can be the difference
between success or failure.

414
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,150
- I stole his shield.
- What?

415
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,356
Today, my good friend, your gym teacher...

416
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,147
...will conduct
the Captain America Fitness Challenge.

417
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,405
Thank you, Captain.

418
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:01,613
Pretty sure he's a war criminal,
but I have to show these videos.

419
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,995
It's required by the state. Let's do it.

420
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,655
Do Avengers have to pay taxes?

421
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,449
What does Hulk smell like?

422
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,618
- I bet he smells nice.
- You have to shut up.

423
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,503
Is Captain America cool,
or is he like a mean, old grandpa?

424
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,585
Ned, just... okay?

425
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:18,251
- Hey, can I be your guy in the chair?
- What?

426
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,966
Yeah. You know how there's a guy
with a headset...

427
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,972
...telling the other guy where to go?

428
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,976
If you're in a burning building,
I could tell you where to go.

429
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,728
There'd be screens around me,
and I could swivel around.

430
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,981
- I could be your guy in the chair.
- I don't need a guy in the chair.

431
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,813
Looking good, Parker.

432
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:39,481
Now, see, for me, it would be F Thor...

433
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,524
...marry Iron Man and kill Hulk.

434
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,534
Well, what about the Spider-Man?

435
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:44,911
It's just Spider-Man.

436
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,289
Did you see the bank security cam
on YouTube? He fought off four guys.

437
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,290
Oh, my God, she's crushing on Spider-Man.

438
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,541
No way.

439
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,749
- Kind of.
- Oh, gross.

440
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,839
- He's probably 30.
- You don't know what he looks like.

441
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,966
Like, what if he's seriously burned?

442
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,844
I wouldn't care. I'd love him
for the person he is inside.

443
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,880
Peter knows Spider-Man.

444
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,847
No, I don't. No. I... I mean...

445
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,350
They're friends.

446
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,482
Yeah, like Coach Wilson
and Captain America are friends.

447
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,360
I've met him, yeah. A couple times.

448
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:18,899
But it's...

449
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,773
...through the Stark internship.

450
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,573
Yeah, well, I'm not really supposed
to talk about it.

451
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,612
Well, that's awesome. Hey, you know what?

452
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,452
Maybe you should invite him
to Liz's party. Right?

453
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:33,915
Yeah, I'm having people over tonight.
You're more than welcome to come.

454
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,500
- Having a party?
- Yeah, it's gonna be dope.

455
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,461
You should totally invite
your personal friend Spider-Man.

456
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,171
It's okay.

457
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:44,053
I know Peter's way too busy
for parties anyway, so...

458
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,055
Come on. He'll be there. Right, Parker?

459
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,892
What are you doing?

460
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,557
Helping you out.

461
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,316
Did you not hear her?

462
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,944
Liz has a crush on you.

463
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,440
Dude, you're an Avenger.

464
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:08,487
If any one of us has a chance
with a senior girl, it's you.

465
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,292
House party in the suburbs.

466
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,829
Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous.

467
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,214
It'll be a night to remember.

468
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,501
Ned, some hats wear men. You wear that hat.

469
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,636
Yeah, it gives me confidence.

470
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,013
This is a mistake.

471
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,423
Hey, let's just go home.

472
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,057
Oh, Peter.

473
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,970
I know. I know it's really hard...

474
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,389
...trying to fit in with all the changes
your body's going through.

475
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,602
It's flowering now.

476
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,853
He's so stressed out lately.

477
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,612
What helps with stress is a party.

478
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,650
- We should go to the party.
- Yeah, let's do it. I'm gonna go.

479
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,702
Peter.

480
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,701
- Have fun, okay? Okay.
- I will.

481
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,740
Bye, May.

482
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,745
Dude, you have the suit, right?

483
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,164
- Yeah.
- This is gonna change our lives.

484
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,008
- Annie, over here!
- Hey.

485
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,342
Hey.

486
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,344
DJ Flash.

487
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,480
Okay. We're gonna have Spider-Man swing in...

488
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:21,609
...say you guys are tight, and I get
a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs.

489
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,895
Can't believe you're at this lame party.

490
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,279
But you're here too.

491
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,986
Am I?

492
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,781
Oh, my gosh.

493
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,742
Hey, guys. Cool hat, Ned.

494
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,656
- Hi, Liz.
- Hi, Liz.

495
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,700
I'm so happy you guys came.

496
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:40,370
There's pizza and drinks. Help yourself.

497
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,839
- What a great party.
- Thanks.

498
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,752
Oh, I...

499
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,592
My parents will kill me
if anything's broken. I gotta...

500
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,223
- Yeah.
- Have fun.

501
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,349
- Bye.
- Bye.

502
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,511
Dude, what are you doing?

503
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,771
She's here. Spider it up.

504
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,557
No, no, no. I can't... I cannot do this.

505
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,977
Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay?

506
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,817
Look, I'm just gonna be myself.

507
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,281
Peter, no one wants that.

508
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,241
Dude.

509
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:14,533
Penis Parker, what's up?

510
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,531
So where's your pal Spider-Man?

511
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,246
Let me guess: In Canada
with your imaginary girlfriend?

512
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:24,876
That's not Spider-Man.
That's just Ned in a red shirt.

513
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,594
"Hey, what's up? I'm Spider-Man.

514
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,806
Just thought I'd swing by
and say hello to my buddy Peter.

515
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,141
Oh, what's up, Ned?
Hey, where's Peter, anyways?

516
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,147
He must be around..."

517
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,564
God, this is stupid. What am I doing?

518
00:31:58,667 --> 00:31:59,783
What the hell?

519
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,350
This sucks.

520
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:31,906
Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed
sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia.

521
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,361
Here. You try.

522
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:38,326
I wanted something low-key.
Why are you trying to upsell me, man?

523
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,581
Okay, okay. I got what you need, all right?

524
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,538
I got tons of great stuff here. One sec.

525
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:48,757
Okay, I got black hole grenades,
Chitauri railguns...

526
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,008
You letting off shots
in public now? Hurry up.

527
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:54,797
Look, times are changing. We're the only
ones selling these high-tech weapons.

528
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,223
This must be where
the ATM robbers got their stuff.

529
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:02,763
I need something to stick up somebody.
I'm not trying to shoot them back in time.

530
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,147
I got antigrav climbers.

531
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,398
Yo, climbers?

532
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:10,190
Okay, what the hell is that?

533
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,364
- Did you set us up?
- Hey, hey, man.

534
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,705
Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna shoot
at somebody, shoot at me.

535
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:21,990
All right.

536
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,630
What was that?

537
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,943
- We gotta call him.
- No, no, no.

538
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:57,904
Did you just do it again?

539
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,240
- Shut up.
- I'm calling him.

540
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,334
Toomes's phone.

541
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:13,878
Boss.

542
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,168
Oh, my butt!

543
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,986
Great. Guess I'm gonna have
to take a shortcut.

544
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,824
Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.

545
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,739
Hey, hey, buddy.

546
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,408
Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch.

547
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,754
Now, this is more like it.

548
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,551
Smells really good.

549
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,189
Great movie!

550
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,280
Oh, hey, guys.

551
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:21,363
No! No!

552
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,244
Hey, it's Peter. Leave a message.

553
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,905
Peter, where are you?

554
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,948
The hat's not working. This is not cool.

555
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,994
Almost got you.

556
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,466
Thought you got away from me, didn't you?

557
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,843
I got you right where I want you.

558
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,846
Surprise!

559
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,939
What the hell?

560
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,943
Oh, hey.

561
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:51,453
And then he just, like,
swooped down like a monster...

562
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:55,165
...and picked me up, and took me up
like a thousand feet and just dropped me.

563
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,164
How'd you find me?
Did you put a tracker in my suit?

564
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,173
I put everything in your suit.

565
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,675
Including this heater.

566
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,347
That's better. Thanks.

567
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,678
What were you thinking?

568
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:12,141
The guy with wings is the source
of the weapons. I gotta take him down.

569
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,975
Take him down now, huh?

570
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,937
Crockett, there are people
who handle this sort of thing.

571
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,944
- The Avengers?
- No. This is a little below their pay grade.

572
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:22,105
Mr. Stark, you didn't have to come out here.

573
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,693
I had that. I was fine.

574
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,284
Oh, I'm not here.

575
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,950
Thank God this place has Wi-Fi...

576
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,910
...or you would be toast right now.

577
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,076
Thank Ganesh while you're at it. Cheers.

578
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,415
Look, forget the flying vulture guy, please.

579
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:38,625
- Why?
- Why?

580
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,835
Because I said so!

581
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:44,002
Sorry, I'm talking to a teenager.

582
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,636
Stay close to the ground.

583
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:49,845
Build up your game helping little people,
like that lady that bought you the churro.

584
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:53,390
Can't you just be a friendly...

585
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,388
...neighborhood Spider-Man?

586
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,272
But I'm ready for more than that now.

587
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:58,812
No, you're not.

588
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,272
That's not what you thought
when I took on Captain America.

589
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,063
Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted
to lay you out, he would've.

590
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:08,986
Listen to me. If you come across
these weapons again, call Happy.

591
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,619
Are you driving?

592
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,782
You know, it's never too early
to start thinking about college.

593
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,699
I got some pull at MIT. End call.

594
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,581
No, I don't need to go to...

595
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:20,792
Mr. Stark is no longer connected.

596
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,342
That's awesome.

597
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,431
"Stay close to the ground"?
What is he talking about?

598
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,153
Hey, what's up? I'm on my way back.

599
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,539
Actually, I was calling to say
maybe you shouldn't come. Listen.

600
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,870
When I say "penis," you say "Parker."

601
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,080
- Penis!
- Parker!

602
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,461
- Penis!
- Parker!

603
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:03,206
Sorry, Peter. I guess we're still losers.

604
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:06,296
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- I'll see you tomorrow in school.

605
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,049
Idiots.

606
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,003
Idiots.

607
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,715
Idiots!

608
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:53,593
Boss?

609
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:57,222
Your wife keeps texting you.
Something about a brake light.

610
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,807
What'd I tell you about looking at my phone?

611
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,222
Sorry. You left it out.

612
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,231
You know I'm a curious person by nature.

613
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:08,271
I finished designing
that high-altitude vacuum seal.

614
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,525
In case you want to,
you know, go for the big one?

615
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,739
You're still on that? I told you, no.

616
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,449
The answer's no. Forget it.

617
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,589
I mean, that was badass.

618
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:37,091
How many times have I told you
not to fire them out in the open?

619
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,806
- You said, move the merchandise.
- Under the radar.

620
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,186
Under the radar!

621
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,097
That's how we survive.

622
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,608
If you bring Damage Control
or the Avengers down here, we're through.

623
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:50,195
You're out there wearing that goofy thing,
lighting up cars...

624
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:51,856
...calling yourself the Shocker.

625
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:55,151
"I'm the Shocker. I shock people."
What is this, pro wrestling?

626
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:57,115
Whatever, old man. Come on.

627
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,992
Look.

628
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,577
Look.

629
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,414
I know you don't give a crap about anything.

630
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,203
But I do.

631
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,499
I built this whole place
because I got people I have to look after.

632
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:12,885
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

633
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,550
You know what?

634
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,387
I can't afford your bullshit.

635
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,017
- Get out of here.
- What?

636
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:24,476
- You're done. You're off the crew.
- Yeah, all right.

637
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,394
All right.

638
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,980
Wonder if you can afford me
out there, though, right?

639
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,985
With everything I know.

640
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:34,782
- Excuse me?
- I'm just saying...

641
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:38,782
...maybe your wife would like to know
where you really get your money from.

642
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,196
- You know what?
- What?

643
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,743
You're right.

644
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,374
- That work?
- I don't know.

645
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,206
I can't afford that.

646
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:49,914
Wait.

647
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,047
Damn.

648
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,010
- I thought this was the antigravity gun.
- What?

649
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,268
No, that's that one.

650
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:18,780
Here.

651
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,948
Now you're the Shocker. Go out there
and find that weapon he lost.

652
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,161
All right.

653
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:36,381
Hey, thanks for bailing on me.

654
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,511
Yeah, well, something came up.

655
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,888
What is that?

656
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:42,846
I don't know.
Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.

657
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,476
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

658
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,102
Awesome.

659
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,356
I mean, not awesome.
Totally uncool of that guy.

660
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,312
So scary.

661
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,315
Well, look, I think it's...

662
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:55,946
...a power source.

663
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,698
Yeah, but it's connected
to all these microprocessors.

664
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:02,077
That's an inductive charging plate. That's
what I use to charge my toothbrush.

665
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,284
Whoever's making these weapons
is combining alien tech with ours.

666
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:09,327
That is literally the coolest sentence
anyone has ever said.

667
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:12,542
I just want to thank you
for letting me be part of your journey...

668
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,082
...into this amazing...

669
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,716
Keep your fingers clear of the blades.

670
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,967
I gotta figure out what this is
and who makes it.

671
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,352
We'll go to the lab after class
and run tests.

672
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:28,808
Let's do it.

673
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,567
First, we put the glowy thing
in the mass spectrometer.

674
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,199
We gotta come up with a better name
than "glowy thingy."

675
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:42,450
You're right.

676
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,071
Crap.

677
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,163
Come on, come on, come on.

678
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,374
High schools creep me out.

679
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,047
They got this funny smell, you know?

680
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,504
Hey, that's one of the guys
that tried to kill me.

681
00:43:58,678 --> 00:43:59,714
What?

682
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,378
- Yeah.
- We gotta get out of here.

683
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,422
No, no, no. I gotta follow them.

684
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,182
They can lead me to the guy
that dropped me in the lake.

685
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,594
- Someone dropped you in a lake?
- Yeah, it was not good.

686
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,017
- Peter...
- No. Stay there, Ned.

687
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,773
Peter.

688
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,065
What are you doing?

689
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:19,480
Nothing.

690
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,819
Yeah. You good?

691
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,029
Chess.

692
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:29,411
Man, can you imagine what the boss
would say if he knew where we were?

693
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:31,667
It's saying there was an energy pulse here.

694
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,247
There's no sign of the weapon.

695
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:36,380
- And even if it was here, now it's gone.
- So are we.

696
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:11,911
This is so awesome.

697
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,916
I know, right?

698
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,918
They're in Brooklyn.

699
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,052
Staten Island.

700
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,682
Leaving Jersey.

701
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:41,937
They stopped.

702
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:45,740
Maryland?

703
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,152
- What's there?
- I don't know.

704
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:49,365
Evil lair?

705
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,951
- They have a lair?
- A gang with alien guns...

706
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,911
...run by a guy with wings? Yeah.

707
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,496
Badass.

708
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,538
But how are you gonna get there
if it's, like, 300 miles away?

709
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,383
It's not too far from D.C.

710
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,586
- Hey, it's Peter.
- Guys.

711
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:06,799
- Peter?
- Hey, buddy.

712
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:08,839
I was hoping I could rejoin the team.

713
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,632
No, no way. You can't quit on us...

714
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,427
...stroll up and be welcomed back
by everyone.

715
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,472
Hey, welcome back!
Flash, you're back to first alternate.

716
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:17,981
- What?
- He's taking your place.

717
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,516
Excuse me, can we go already?

718
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:23,483
I was hoping to get in some protesting
in front of an embassy before dinner.

719
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:26,114
Protesting is patriotic.
Let's get on the bus.

720
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:31,366
Focus up.
Our next topic is the moons of Saturn.

721
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:33,447
The second law of thermodynamics.

722
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,912
- Frank Sinatra.
- Fort Sumter.

723
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,914
- Flash is wrong.
- Okay, let's focus. Next one.

724
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:40,420
Liz, don't overwork them.

725
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,630
Strontium, barium, vibranium.

726
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,666
Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back.

727
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,301
Glad to be back.

728
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:50,131
- What is the current standard unit of...
- Can I take this real quick?

729
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:51,799
Yeah, fine.

730
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,763
- Hello?
- Got a blip on my screen here.

731
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:54,972
You left New York?

732
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:56,762
- Okay, focus up, everyone.
- Tracker.

733
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,056
Yeah, it's just a school trip. It's nothing.

734
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,646
Happy, I gotta say,
tracking me without permission...

735
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,606
...is a complete violation of privacy.

736
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:06,112
- That's different.
- What's different?

737
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:08,740
Nothing. Look, it's just
the Academic Decathlon.

738
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:11,993
- It's no big deal.
- Hey, hey. I'll decide if it's no big deal.

739
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,748
Sounds like no big deal,
but remember, I'm watching you.

740
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:30,717
- Everyone stick together.
- Yeah.

741
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,055
You kidding me? This place is huge.

742
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,808
- I've seen bigger.
- There's a bird in here.

743
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:39,221
- Hey, you brought your laptop, right?
- Why?

744
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,647
Peter...

745
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:51,817
...why are we removing
the tracker from your suit?

746
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:56,450
I gotta follow these guys to their boss
before they move again...

747
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:59,583
...and I don't really want Mr. Stark
to know about it.

748
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:01,584
So you're lying to Iron Man now?

749
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,370
No, I'm not lying.

750
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:06,164
He just doesn't really get what I can do yet.

751
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:12,254
Gotcha.

752
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:16,596
All right, Happy, enjoy tracking this lamp.

753
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,601
There's a ton of other subsystems in here...

754
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:26,394
...but they're all disabled
by the Training Wheels Protocol.

755
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,686
What?

756
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:31,482
"Training Wheels Protocol"? Turn it off.

757
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:34,572
I don't think that's a good idea.
They're blocked for a reason.

758
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,328
Come on, man, I don't need training wheels.

759
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,865
I'm sick of him treating me
like a kid all the time.

760
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,329
- It's not cool.
- But you are a kid.

761
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,586
A kid who can stop a bus with his bare hands.

762
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:48,499
Peter, I just don't think this is a great
idea. I mean, what if this is illegal?

763
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:51,635
Look, please.
This is my chance to prove myself.

764
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:53,545
I can handle it. Ned, come on.

765
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:56,430
- I don't think this is a good idea.
- The guy in the chair.

766
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:59,054
- Don't do that.
- Come on.

767
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,071
The glowy thing, it's evidence. Keep it safe.

768
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:16,826
- All right?
- Okay. Okay.

769
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:19,992
- They're moving.
- Be careful.

770
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,706
- Hey, Liz.
- Perfect timing.

771
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,288
We're gonna go swimming.

772
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,127
- Come on, come on, come on.
- What?

773
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,541
- Hey, Peter.
- Hi.

774
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,552
Hey.

775
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:39,016
I was... I was gonna go study
in the business center.

776
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:41,518
You don't need to.
You're the smartest guy I've ever met.

777
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:42,973
And besides...

778
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:46,936
...a rebellious group activity the day
before competition is good for morale.

779
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,485
Well, I read that in a TED Talk, so...

780
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,896
I... I heard it in a TED Talk.

781
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,985
And I read a coaching book.

782
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,159
You really...
This is really important to you.

783
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,195
Yeah. It's our future.

784
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,783
I'm not gonna screw it up.

785
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:06,702
Besides, we raided the minibar
and these candy bars were, like, $11.

786
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:10,122
- So get your trunks on and come on.
- Come on.

787
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:12,416
- Come on.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

788
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:13,629
Let's go.

789
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,777
- Good evening, Peter.
- Hello? Hello?

790
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:42,867
Congratulations on completing
the Training Wheels Protocol...

791
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,578
...and gaining access
to your suit's full capabilities.

792
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,333
Thank you.

793
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:49,335
Where would you like to take me tonight?

794
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:52,213
I put a tracker on someone. He's a bad guy.

795
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,420
Tracker located.

796
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,127
Plotting course to intercept target.

797
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:00,388
As long as I make it back
in time for decathlon, it's fine.

798
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:11,107
One hundred meters
from destination and closing.

799
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,101
Jump now.

800
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,608
Detecting three individuals.

801
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:23,950
Why is their secret lair
in a gas station? That's so lame.

802
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,743
Hey, suit lady, what are they doing?

803
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,206
Do you want to hear what they're saying?

804
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,838
I can hear what they're saying? Yeah.

805
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:35,920
Activating Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.

806
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:39,006
I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup.
The rest is my design.

807
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,511
Whoa, that's so cool.

808
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:42,513
Can't believe they're still cleaning up
that Triskelion mess.

809
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,675
I love it. They keep making messes...

810
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:47,219
- ...we keep getting rich.
- Target inbound.

811
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:49,012
They're in the middle of a heist.

812
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,351
I could catch them red-handed.
This is awesome.

813
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,812
Okay, I'll get closer
to see what's happening.

814
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:56,694
Would you like me
to engage Enhanced Combat Mode?

815
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:59,197
"Enhanced Combat Mode"? Yeah.

816
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,823
Activating Instant Kill.

817
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:03,076
No, no, no. I don't want to kill anybody.

818
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,532
Deactivating Instant Kill.

819
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,241
Did you hear that?

820
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,626
What the hell just happened? What was that?

821
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,209
You jumped off the sign
and landed on your face.

822
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,087
What's wrong with my web-shooters?

823
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,594
Rapid-fire is the default
for Enhanced Combat Mode.

824
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:24,472
- Why would I need rapid-fire?
- Would you like to see more options?

825
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:27,635
You have 576 possible
web-shooter combinations.

826
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:29,519
Mr. Stark really overdid it.

827
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:30,849
You two wait right here.

828
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:33,140
Wait. You're gonna want
to turn on the dampers.

829
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:36,651
- That thing will shatter your arm.
- All right, where's the dampers?

830
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,482
- That one.
- Great choice.

831
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,231
Would you like me to set this
as your new default?

832
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:43,776
No, no, no.

833
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:46,490
- Push that in. No, the other...
- Here? This one here?

834
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,997
- What was that?
- Taser webs.

835
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,998
Taser webs? I don't want Taser webs.

836
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,660
You seem to be unfamiliar
with your web-shooter settings.

837
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,878
Would you like to run a refresher course?

838
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:58,381
- No. Just... You choose.
- Sure thing.

839
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,213
Six-alpha-niner, are you running on time?

840
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:04,846
Copy, central. Six-alpha-niner on schedule.

841
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,516
- I got a visual.
- Green light, green light.

842
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:15,394
Oh, that's him.

843
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,191
Okay. I got eyes on the convoy.

844
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:22,776
Pulling in behind the caboose.

845
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:25,612
Deploy anchors.

846
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:37,754
Dropping down.

847
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:42,254
No outgoing distress signals. You're clear.

848
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,510
Hey. Looks like they got
some good stuff here.

849
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:58,816
Cool. It's like some kind of
matter phase shifter.

850
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:05,361
All right, coming up.

851
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:12,823
Hey, Big Bird. This doesn't belong to you.

852
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,617
Oh, God.

853
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,918
- Suit lady, what was that?!
- You told me to choose.

854
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,467
What? No, just set everything back to normal.

855
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,886
Activating all systems.

856
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:48,821
My head.

857
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,782
You appear to have a mild concussion.

858
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:57,163
Hey, so where am I right now?

859
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:58,452
I'm not sure.

860
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,166
The container walls are hindering my sensors.

861
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,207
Wait a minute.

862
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:07,923
They must have hijacked the truck
and taken me to their evil lair.

863
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,844
Okay, suit lady, we're gonna have
to fight our way out of this one.

864
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,263
Three, two, one.

865
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:22,525
What is this place?

866
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,935
Suit lady, where am I?

867
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,900
You're in the most secure facility
on the eastern seaboard.

868
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:28,781
The Damage Control deep storage vault.

869
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:31,443
No. Seriously?

870
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:36,785
The door will most likely remain closed
until morning.

871
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,245
Morning?

872
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:43,504
Hey, suit lady. I kind of feel bad
calling you "suit lady," you know?

873
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,961
I think I should probably give you a name.

874
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,467
Like Liz. No, no, no.

875
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:50,629
God, that's... That's weird.

876
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:53,173
What about Karen?

877
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,432
You can call me Karen if you would like.

878
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:58,720
Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do?

879
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:00,809
What?

880
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:02,895
Maybe we should run that refresher course.

881
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:05,230
- Ricochet web.
- Ricochet web.

882
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:08,272
- Cool.
- Splitter web.

883
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:12,317
- Web grenade.
- Web grenade!

884
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,742
Should I tell Liz that I'm Spider-Man?

885
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:17,951
Who is Liz?

886
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,788
Who's Liz? She's...

887
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:22,418
She's the best. She's awesome.

888
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:25,296
She's just a girl who goes to my school.

889
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,501
And...

890
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:30,589
Yeah, I just... I really want to tell her,
but it's kind of weird, you know?

891
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:33,971
"Hey, I'm Spider-Man."

892
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:35,257
What's weird about that?

893
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:37,471
What if she's expecting
someone like Tony Stark?

894
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,636
Imagine how disappointed
she'd be when she sees me.

895
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:43,352
Well, if I were her,
I wouldn't be disappointed at all.

896
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,016
Thanks, Karen.

897
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,936
It's really nice to have somebody to talk to.

898
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,945
Hey, how long we been here anyways?

899
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,981
- Thirty-seven minutes.
- What?!

900
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:53,866
Thirty-seven minutes? That's insane.

901
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:57,700
I cannot take this anymore.
I got to... I gotta get out of here.

902
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:02,459
There's got to be something in here
I can use.

903
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,244
Okay, let's see.

904
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:06,958
Nope.

905
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,336
That's awesome.

906
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,426
Hey, it's like the glowy thing.

907
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:15,589
That glowy thing is
an explosive Chitauri energy core.

908
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,758
You mean, we've been carrying around a bomb?

909
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:21,645
It would require radiation
to transform it into an explosive state.

910
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:24,480
No, no, no.

911
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:31,230
Hey! Please!
Please, somebody let me out! Hey!

912
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,318
Karen, you have to help me override
that time lock.

913
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:36,068
Okay, Karen, lower the voltage and run it.

914
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,735
Trial unsuccessful.

915
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:40,576
Okay, we're just gonna have
to try every sequence.

916
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:46,286
Ned, Peter, we're gonna be late.
Come on, let's go.

917
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,750
Okay. Hold on, hold on.

918
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,636
Initiating trial 247.

919
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,547
It worked. It works.

920
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:13,606
Please be sure
all cell phones are turned off.

921
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:14,818
Thank you.

922
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:16,858
Karen, get me to decathlon
as fast as possible.

923
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,151
Sure thing. Just tell me where it is.

924
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,990
Across the street
from the Washington Monument.

925
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:23,122
- It's Ned. Leave a message.
- Call me back. The glowy thing's a bomb!

926
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,088
There's a vehicle approaching on your right.

927
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:33,466
We have now entered sudden death.

928
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:36,423
The next correct answer wins
the championship.

929
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,679
Midtown Tech?

930
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,469
Zero.

931
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:45,682
That is correct.

932
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,727
Midtown takes the championship.

933
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:52,227
- We won.
- You guys, I am so proud of you.

934
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:55,568
- Told you we didn't need Peter.
- Flash, you didn't answer a question.

935
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:58,700
- Taking it all in, Michelle?
- Oh, yeah, I just...

936
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,202
I don't want to celebrate something
that was built by slaves.

937
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,829
I'm sure the Washington Monument
wasn't built by...

938
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:08,330
Okay.

939
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,957
- Enjoy your book.
- Thanks.

940
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:16,000
- Oh, Ned, you're alive.
- Peter, are you okay?

941
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:17,760
Where's the glowy thing? The glowy thing?

942
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:21,513
- It's safe. It's in my backpack.
- Ned, listen, the glowy thing is dangerous.

943
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,265
You missed the decathlon. I covered for you.

944
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:25,347
- Listen.
- We're at the Washington Monument.

945
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,886
- Peter, is that you?
- Hey, Liz.

946
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:28,475
- Is that Liz?
- Put Ned back on the phone.

947
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:31,766
- You should tell her how you feel.
- You flake. You are lucky we won.

948
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:35,527
I want to be mad, but I'm more worried.
Like, what is going on with you?

949
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,188
I have to talk to Ned. It's important.

950
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:39,607
- All items on the belt, please.
- There's something in Ned's backpack.

951
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:41,868
It's dangerous.
Don't let it go through x-ray.

952
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:46,952
Liz? Liz! Damn it.

953
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:52,749
Can I be the one to tell Peter he's expelled?

954
00:59:56,968 --> 01:00:02,714
The Washington Monument is 555 feet,
five and one-eighth inches tall.

955
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:07,469
Notice how the marble and granite
are cut around the stone.

956
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:17,316
No, no, no. Karen, what's going on up there?

957
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:19,814
The Chitauri core has detonated...

958
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,983
...and caused severe structural damage
to the elevator.

959
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,367
- Oh, no.
- My friends are up there.

960
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:26,075
What? Don't worry, ma'am,
everything's gonna be okay.

961
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:28,331
Excuse me, excuse me.
Oh, my God, that's tall.

962
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:35,913
Oh, my God. Look at the ceiling.

963
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:37,582
Just stay calm, everyone.

964
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,421
Oh, we are all going to die here.

965
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,718
Estimating 10 minutes
before catastrophic failure.

966
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,382
We're freaking screwed.

967
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,678
Okay, I know that was scary,
but our safety systems are working.

968
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:52,268
The safety systems are completely failing.

969
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,102
We're very safe in here.

970
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:56,859
The occupants are in imminent mortal danger.

971
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,109
Going as fast as I can!

972
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:09,163
- Let's go.
- Give me your hand.

973
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:12,871
You now have 125 seconds
until catastrophic failure.

974
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:14,080
What?! Why?

975
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:17,581
Unexpected motion has caused
the deterioration to escalate.

976
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:21,216
- How do I get in there?
- Activating reconnaissance drone.

977
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:25,964
Has that been there this whole time?
That's awesome.

978
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:28,675
Locating optimal entry point.

979
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:32,057
Proceed to southwest window.

980
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,971
Karen, I'm on my way.

981
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:40,520
- There's a lot of glass here.
- You got this.

982
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:41,904
Keep coming, keep coming.

983
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,954
Okay. Oh, my God.

984
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,793
Okay.

985
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:03,505
What's wrong? You've reached
the southwest window.

986
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,419
- Why are you hesitating?
- It's fine.

987
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:07,304
I've just never been this high before.

988
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:09,636
You have also not reinstalled
your parachute...

989
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,517
...so a fall from this height
would most likely be lethal.

990
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,604
Perfect.

991
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:17,356
Oh, my God.

992
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:20,018
Why is it not breaking?

993
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:23,859
It's four-inch ballistic glass.
You'll have to create more momentum.

994
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:45,426
This is D.C. Metro Police. Identify yourself.

995
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,177
My friends are in there! Stop!

996
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,088
Return to the ground immediately.

997
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:51,258
- Okay, who's next?
- Me, it's my turn.

998
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,266
Flash, seriously? What are you doing?

999
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:56,395
- Come on.
- Don't worry about the trophy.

1000
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,024
Stand down!

1001
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,941
Return to the ground immediately.

1002
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,114
Return to the ground or we will open fire!

1003
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,123
Go up, go up.

1004
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,326
I got this.

1005
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:20,165
Take my trophy.

1006
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:24,215
This is your last chance.

1007
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:26,421
I'm gonna die.

1008
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,142
Break!

1009
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:51,989
I did it.

1010
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:07,549
Hey, how you doing? Don't worry. I got you.

1011
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:10,549
- Yes! Yes.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1012
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:12,805
- Big guy, quit moving around.
- I'm sorry, sir.

1013
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:17,472
Let's go, let's go!

1014
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,396
Okay, okay.

1015
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:26,526
- Mr. Harrington, go.
- Ned, come on.

1016
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,483
- This is your stop.
- Come on, Liz.

1017
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:31,569
Go, go, go. Everybody out.
Move it, people. Move it, move it.

1018
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:33,234
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Liz.

1019
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:35,369
Liz!

1020
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:41,246
You're okay. You're okay.

1021
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:46,122
Okay.

1022
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:47,960
- Oh, my God.
- Good, good.

1023
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,000
Come on up. Come on, you guys, stay back.

1024
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:52,170
- Come on in.
- You guys good?

1025
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:53,713
So is everyone okay?

1026
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:57,175
This is your chance, Peter.

1027
01:04:57,352 --> 01:04:59,184
Kiss her.

1028
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:04,603
Thank you.

1029
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:10,150
Are you really friends with Peter Parker?

1030
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:21,992
I can finish the next order, but without
any new materials from that truck...

1031
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,747
Yeah, damn it.

1032
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,463
We still have enough to do
the Gargan deal though, right?

1033
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:29,624
Yeah, but then that's it.

1034
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:35,846
Maybe it is time
that I built the high-altitude seal.

1035
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:37,597
- Would you shut up about that?
- It's only one job.

1036
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,258
No.

1037
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:44,013
Eight years, not a word from the feds,
nothing from those...

1038
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:48,230
...Halloween-costume-wearing bozos
up there in Stark Tower.

1039
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:53,114
And then all of a sudden,
this little bastard in red tights shows up.

1040
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:56,947
And he thinks he can tear down
everything I've built.

1041
01:05:58,455 --> 01:05:59,991
Really?

1042
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,327
I'm gonna kill him.

1043
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,537
- I'm gonna find him...
- Found him.

1044
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:05,997
The Spider-Man swooped in...

1045
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:09,084
...heroically saving an Academic
Decathlon team from Queens.

1046
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:12,465
The identity of the masked hero
is still unknown.

1047
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:17,467
- Mom.
- Oh, kids. All right.

1048
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,132
Peter. Come here, come here, come here.

1049
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:26,555
This past weekend,
Midtown's Academic Decathlon team...

1050
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:29,692
...defeated the country's best
to win the national championship.

1051
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:31,523
Later that day, they also defeated death.

1052
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:34,109
Explosion. Sally scream.
Flash scream. Everybody screaming.

1053
01:06:34,282 --> 01:06:38,071
There were purple lasers and smoke.
It was **** tight, like a Bon Jovi concert.

1054
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:41,612
As you know, we made it out alive,
and that's the important thing.

1055
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:44,873
I couldn't bear to lose
a student on a school trip.

1056
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:47,163
Not again.

1057
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:51,047
Thankfully, no one was seriously injured
thanks to the Spider-Man.

1058
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,461
- Thank you, Spider-Man.
- Thank you, Spider-Man.

1059
01:06:53,635 --> 01:06:56,548
Up next: the Spider-Man mania
is sweeping the school.

1060
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:59,338
How can you show your spider spirit?

1061
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,181
Dude, dude, dude.

1062
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:08,063
What is it like being famous
when nobody knows it's you?

1063
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:09,690
- Crazy, dude.
- It's crazy.

1064
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,691
- Should we tell everyone?
- No.

1065
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:14,649
- Should I tell everyone?
- No, dude. That's not a good idea.

1066
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:18,157
- Okay, come on, we'll be late to class.
- I'm not going to class.

1067
01:07:18,326 --> 01:07:20,067
You're already in trouble
for ditching the decathlon.

1068
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:21,781
Dude, listen, I figured it out.

1069
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:23,867
The wingsuit guy is stealing
from Damage Control.

1070
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,033
What he takes from Damage Control,
that's how he builds the weapons.

1071
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:30,123
- So all I gotta do is catch him.
- But we have a Spanish quiz.

1072
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:32,504
Ned, I'm probably never gonna come back here.

1073
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:35,712
Mr. Stark is moving the Avengers upstate...

1074
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,842
- ...so when I bring this guy in...
- Dude.

1075
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:39,924
You want to be a high school dropout?

1076
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:42,761
I am so far beyond high school right now.

1077
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:45,642
Parker, my office.

1078
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:49,930
So...

1079
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:51,599
...you got detention.

1080
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:53,938
You screwed up.
You know what you did was wrong.

1081
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:56,479
The question is,
how are you gonna make things right?

1082
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:57,817
Maybe you were trying to be cool.

1083
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:01,196
But take it from a guy
who's been frozen for 65 years...

1084
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:04,487
...the only way to really be cool
is to follow the rules.

1085
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:08,115
We all know what's right.
We all know what's wrong.

1086
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:10,831
Next time those turkeys try
to convince you of something...

1087
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:13,246
- ...you know is wrong...
- Where you going? Get back here.

1088
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:15,790
...just think to yourself,
what would Captain America do?

1089
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:17,754
Why are you here? You don't have detention.

1090
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:21,511
Oh, I know. I just like coming here
to sketch people in crisis.

1091
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:26,262
It's you.

1092
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:30,513
So your body's changing.
Believe me, I know how that feels.

1093
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,780
May?

1094
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:48,326
Hey, Karen. What's up?

1095
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:50,286
Hey, Peter. How was your Spanish quiz?

1096
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:51,541
I was wondering if you could help me.

1097
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:54,203
I'm trying to figure out who the guys
under the bridge were that night...

1098
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,838
...but I can only remember
part of a license plate.

1099
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:59,796
I can run facial recognition
on the footage of that encounter.

1100
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,460
- Footage?
- Yes, Peter.

1101
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,504
I record everything you see.

1102
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:04,797
- Everything?
- Everything.

1103
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,307
- All the time?
- It's called the Baby-Monitor Protocol.

1104
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:10,014
Yeah, of course it is.

1105
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:14,064
- Yeah, just roll it back to last Friday.
- With pleasure.

1106
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:16,099
Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party.

1107
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,860
Hey, what's up, Liz?
Peter's told me a lot about you.

1108
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:20,987
No, no, no. This is just me messing around.

1109
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,864
Go later in the day, later in the day.

1110
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:25,196
It is I, Thor, son of Odin.

1111
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:26,827
No, no, no. That's definitely...

1112
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,578
That's definitely not
what we wanted to watch.

1113
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:32,241
- Your impressions are very funny.
- Fast-forward to the arms deal.

1114
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:33,704
Okay.

1115
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:37,371
- The two on the right, who are they?
- Searching law enforcement databases.

1116
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:40,249
No records found for two of the individuals.

1117
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,509
- Nothing?
- One individual identified.

1118
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:44,796
Aaron Davis, age 33.

1119
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:47,806
He has a criminal record
and an address here in Queens.

1120
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:49,216
Let's pay him a visit.

1121
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:52,728
Would you like me to activate
the Enhanced Interrogation Protocol?

1122
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:53,978
Yeah.

1123
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,946
- Remember me?
- Hey...

1124
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:12,956
I need information. You'll give it to me now.

1125
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:14,833
- All right, chill.
- Come on!

1126
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:18,203
- What happened to your voice?
- What do you mean?

1127
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:20,464
I heard you by the bridge.
I know what a girl sound like.

1128
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:23,592
I'm not a girl. I'm a boy.
I mean, I'm a... I'm a man.

1129
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:25,593
I don't care what you are, a boy, a girl...

1130
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,425
I'm not a girl. I'm a man.

1131
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:29,931
Come on, man.
Look, who is selling these weapons?

1132
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:32,392
I need to know. Give me names or else.

1133
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:40,355
- You ain't ever done this before, huh?
- Deactivate Interrogation Mode.

1134
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:42,774
Look, man.

1135
01:10:43,448 --> 01:10:46,156
These guys are selling weapons
that are crazy dangerous.

1136
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:47,736
They can't be out on the streets.

1137
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,072
If one of them can cut
Delmar's Bodega in half...

1138
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,829
- You know Delmar's?
- Yeah, best sandwich in Queens.

1139
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:55,207
- Sub Haven's pretty good.
- It's too much bread.

1140
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:57,493
- I like bread.
- Come on, man, please.

1141
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,547
Stupid Interrogation Mode.
Karen, don't ever do that again.

1142
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:06,176
The other night, you told that dude,
"If you shoot somebody, shoot me."

1143
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:07,802
That's pretty ballsy.

1144
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:10,009
I don't want those weapons
in this neighborhood.

1145
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:11,549
I got a nephew who live here.

1146
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,010
Who are these guys?

1147
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:16,099
What can you tell me
about the guy with the wings?

1148
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,514
Other than he's a psychopath
dressed like a demon, nothing.

1149
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,648
I don't know who he is or where he is.

1150
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:27,113
- I do know where he's gonna be.
- Really?

1151
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,525
Yeah, this crazy dude I used to work with...

1152
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:32,115
...he's supposed to be doing a deal with him.

1153
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,904
Yes! Yes.

1154
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:35,663
- Thank...
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

1155
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,120
I didn't tell you where.
You don't have a location.

1156
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,786
Right, of course.
Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just...

1157
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,204
Yeah.

1158
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:44,543
- Where is it?
- Can I give you some advice?

1159
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:47,752
You got to get better
at this part of the job.

1160
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:49,386
I don't understand.

1161
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:50,921
I'm intimidating.

1162
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:53,966
- Staten Island Ferry, 11.
- Oh, that's soon.

1163
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,850
That's gonna dissolve in two hours.

1164
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:58,603
No, no, no. Come fix this.

1165
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:00,435
- Two hours. You deserve that.
- I got ice cream in here.

1166
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:03,191
You deserve that. You're a criminal.
Bye, Mr. Criminal.

1167
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:19,120
Nice.

1168
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:25,038
Okay, Karen, activate
Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.

1169
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:26,252
Sure thing.

1170
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:28,751
He's up front, main deck.

1171
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,339
I hate this guy.

1172
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:32,846
It's the guy from the bridge, right?
Who's that other guy?

1173
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,631
Just keep me posted.

1174
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:36,675
There's no record of him
in my criminal database.

1175
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:39,516
Incoming call from May Parker. Should
I reroute to your heads-up display?

1176
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:42,102
I can't talk right now. I'll call her back.

1177
01:12:42,984 --> 01:12:47,354
Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy.
We can't let anybody get away this time.

1178
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:57,704
- Who's the guy on the left?
- Mac Gargan.

1179
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,287
Extensive criminal record,
including homicide.

1180
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:02,291
Would you like me to activate Instant Kill?

1181
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:05,875
No, Karen, stop it
with the Instant Kill already.

1182
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:09,378
White pickup truck.

1183
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:16,010
Dronie, scan the ship
for a white pickup truck.

1184
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:38,154
Oh, this is too perfect.

1185
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,664
I got the weapons, buyers
and sellers in one place.

1186
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:43,792
- Incoming call from Tony Stark.
- No, no, no.

1187
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:46,123
- Don't answer.
- Mr. Parker. Got a sec?

1188
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:48,710
- I'm actually at school.
- No, you're not.

1189
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:50,749
- Nice work in D.C.
- Okay.

1190
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:53,635
My dad never really gave me
a lot of support...

1191
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:55,966
...and I'm trying to break
the cycle of shame.

1192
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,301
I'm in the middle of something.

1193
01:13:57,475 --> 01:13:58,841
Don't cut me off when I'm complimenting you.

1194
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:02,136
Anyway, great things are about to...
What is that?

1195
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:04,767
I'm at band practice.

1196
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:09,606
That's odd. Happy told me you quit
band six weeks ago. What's up?

1197
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,987
- I gotta go. End call.
- Hey.

1198
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:13,272
I'll take those!

1199
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:20,245
Hey, guys. The illegal weapons-deal ferry
was at 10:30. You missed it.

1200
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:30,872
Spider guy's here.

1201
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:36,045
Not so fast.

1202
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:40,178
Are you guys okay?
My bad. That was a little hard.

1203
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:43,890
I got to say, the other guy was way better
with that thing.

1204
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:45,562
I'm honestly...

1205
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,688
I'm... I'm shocked.

1206
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,702
- Freeze! FBI.
- Don't move.

1207
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:03,659
- Get on the ground.
- FBI.

1208
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:04,869
What do you mean, FBI?

1209
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:08,456
- The Federal Bureau of Investigation.
- I know, but what are they doing here?

1210
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:18,512
Get out of the way. Get out of the way!

1211
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:20,798
No.

1212
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:25,515
Look out, look out, look out.
Move, move, move!

1213
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:32,518
- Move.
- Get to the top deck.

1214
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:34,231
We're getting out of here.

1215
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:15,402
Activate Taser web!

1216
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:29,870
You're messing with things
you don't understand.

1217
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:11,037
Oh, my God. What do I do? Karen...

1218
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:14,453
...give me an x-ray of the boat
and target all the strongest points.

1219
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,336
Web grenade. Web grenade.

1220
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:23,386
Splitter web, go.

1221
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:54,576
Great job, Peter.
You are 98 percent successful.

1222
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:57,996
- Ninety-eight?
- Yeah, Spider-Man!

1223
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:01,758
No, no, no.

1224
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:37,994
What the hell?

1225
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:43,291
What the hell?

1226
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:46,802
Hi, Spider-Man.

1227
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:49,339
Band practice, was it?

1228
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:13,204
Yeah, Iron Man!

1229
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:22,380
Mr. Stark.

1230
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:27,385
Hey, Mr. Stark, could I do anything?
What do you want me to do?

1231
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:30,422
I think you've done enough.

1232
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:47,814
So that's it. You're just gonna run?

1233
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:52,660
Feds were waiting for us.

1234
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:55,493
Now we're on Iron Man's radar?

1235
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:57,912
Yeah, I'm running.

1236
01:19:58,711 --> 01:19:59,872
You should too.

1237
01:20:00,421 --> 01:20:02,253
You know I can't do that.

1238
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:03,630
So now what?

1239
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:08,760
Mason, can you get that high-altitude
seal thing up and running in time?

1240
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:10,921
Seriously?

1241
01:20:11,098 --> 01:20:13,260
Yes. You will not regret this.

1242
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:18,220
You in?

1243
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:30,949
Previously on Peter Screws the Pooch...

1244
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:32,825
...I tell you to stay away from this.

1245
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:35,612
Instead, you hacked
a multimillion-dollar suit...

1246
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:38,031
...so you could sneak around
behind my back...

1247
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:41,042
...doing the one thing I told you not to do.

1248
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:42,201
Is everyone okay?

1249
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:45,580
No thanks to you.

1250
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:48,375
No thanks to me?

1251
01:20:49,928 --> 01:20:52,545
Those weapons were out there,
and I tried to tell you about it...

1252
01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:54,089
...but you didn't listen.

1253
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:57,680
None of this would've happened
if you had just listened to me.

1254
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:59,890
If you even cared, you'd actually be here.

1255
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:07,527
I did listen, kid.
Who do you think called the FBI, huh?

1256
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:10,272
Do you know I was the only one
who believed in you?

1257
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:14,238
Everyone else said I was crazy
to recruit a 14-year-old kid.

1258
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:16,698
- I'm 15.
- No, this is where you zip it, all right?

1259
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:19,455
The adult is talking.
What if somebody had died tonight?

1260
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:22,709
Different story, right?
Because that's on you.

1261
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,210
And if you died...

1262
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:26,588
...I feel like that's on me.

1263
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:28,790
- I don't need that on my conscience.
- Yes, sir.

1264
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:31,584
- I'm sorry. I understand.
- Sorry doesn't cut it.

1265
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:34,133
I just wanted to be like you.

1266
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:35,842
And I wanted you to be better.

1267
01:21:37,601 --> 01:21:39,968
It's not working out.
I'm gonna need the suit back.

1268
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:42,353
- For how long?
- Forever.

1269
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:44,560
- Yeah, that's how it works.
- No, no. Please.

1270
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,645
- Let's have it.
- Please, this is all I have.

1271
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:48,185
I'm nothing without this suit.

1272
01:21:48,946 --> 01:21:51,359
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.

1273
01:21:51,532 --> 01:21:52,693
Okay?

1274
01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:55,074
God, I sound like my dad.

1275
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:58,987
I don't have any other clothes.

1276
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:01,657
Okay, we'll sort that out.

1277
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:13,210
Hey.

1278
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:21,350
I've been calling you all day.
You didn't answer your phone.

1279
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,977
You can't do that.

1280
01:22:23,147 --> 01:22:25,764
Then this ferry thing happens.

1281
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:28,604
I've called five police stations.

1282
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:29,984
Five.

1283
01:22:30,154 --> 01:22:31,941
I called five of your friends.
I called Ned's mother.

1284
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:35,733
I'm fine. May, I'm okay.
Honestly, just relax. I'm fine.

1285
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:37,696
Cut the bullshit.

1286
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:39,532
I know you left detention.

1287
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:42,197
I know you left the hotel room in Washington.

1288
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:44,286
I know you sneak out
of this house every night.

1289
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,746
That's not fine.

1290
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:49,538
Peter, you have to tell me
what's going on. Just lay it out.

1291
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:50,751
It's just me and you.

1292
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:54,250
I lost the Stark internship.

1293
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:56,427
- What?
- Yeah.

1294
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:58,005
What happened?

1295
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:02,642
I just thought that I could work really hard
and he could... He would... You know.

1296
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:05,936
But I screwed it up.

1297
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:07,893
It's okay, it's okay.

1298
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:11,226
It's okay.

1299
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:14,525
I'm sorry I made you worry.

1300
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:16,530
I'm not trying to ruin your life.

1301
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:17,986
Yeah, I know.

1302
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,446
Just...

1303
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,987
- I used to sneak out too.
- Yeah.

1304
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,162
And take a shower. You smell.

1305
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:30,203
You smell like garbage.

1306
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:31,996
I know.

1307
01:23:35,052 --> 01:23:37,385
Peter, you're a good kid
and you're a smart kid...

1308
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:40,171
...so just try to keep
your head straight, okay?

1309
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:42,264
Okay.

1310
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:44,266
All right, get out of here.

1311
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:53,268
Are you expelled?

1312
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:56,438
Do you have to go to that high school
where the principal has a crossbow?

1313
01:23:56,615 --> 01:23:59,949
Pretty sure that's an urban myth,
and, no, I'm not expelled.

1314
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:02,781
You're so lucky.

1315
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:52,285
Hey.

1316
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:55,580
- Hey.
- I thought you had calculus fifth period.

1317
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:58,124
Yeah, I was just doing some homecoming stuff.

1318
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:00,009
Hey, look, I...

1319
01:25:00,887 --> 01:25:03,595
I just wanted to apologize
about the whole decathlon thing.

1320
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:04,846
It's fine.

1321
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:09,057
Last week, decathlon was the most
important thing, but then I almost died.

1322
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:11,141
No, I'm...

1323
01:25:11,315 --> 01:25:13,307
I just mean that...

1324
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:16,355
...it was not cool, especially...

1325
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:19,854
...because...

1326
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:23,699
...I like you.

1327
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:25,693
I know.

1328
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:29,368
You do?

1329
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:32,159
You're terrible at keeping secrets.

1330
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:33,998
Yeah, you'd be surprised.

1331
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:39,669
I got to get to class, but...

1332
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:44,258
I'd say we should hang out,
but I'm gonna be in detention...

1333
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:47,424
...forever, but...

1334
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:49,934
I guess you already have a date
to homecoming.

1335
01:25:50,103 --> 01:25:54,814
Actually, I was so busy planning it,
I never really got around to that part, so...

1336
01:25:56,026 --> 01:25:57,733
Do you want to...

1337
01:25:57,903 --> 01:25:58,939
...go with me?

1338
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:01,737
Yeah. Sure.

1339
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:04,524
Really? I mean, great. Cool.

1340
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:06,321
Cool.

1341
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:09,411
I'm actually going that way.

1342
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:22,466
May, I need your help.

1343
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:40,734
Through or around?

1344
01:26:45,742 --> 01:26:46,983
Right?

1345
01:26:57,337 --> 01:26:59,579
It's game day. So, what's the plan?

1346
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:01,292
Open the door for her.

1347
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:03,879
Tell her she looks nice,
but not too much because that's creepy.

1348
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:05,133
- Don't be creepy.
- No.

1349
01:27:05,303 --> 01:27:07,966
When I dance with her,
I'm putting my hands on her hips.

1350
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:09,881
I got this.

1351
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:13,346
- Love you.
- Bye.

1352
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:29,859
You must be Peter.

1353
01:27:30,704 --> 01:27:31,820
Yeah.

1354
01:27:31,997 --> 01:27:33,533
I'm Liz's dad.

1355
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:35,198
Put her there.

1356
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,328
Hell of a grip.

1357
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:39,789
Come on in here. Come on.

1358
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:04,561
Hi, Peter.

1359
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:06,820
You look very handsome.

1360
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:08,481
Thank you.

1361
01:28:08,658 --> 01:28:10,775
You got his name right?

1362
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:12,318
- Freddie?
- Peter.

1363
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:13,703
Peter. Peter.

1364
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:15,822
I'm gonna go get Liz.

1365
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:17,785
Okay.

1366
01:28:23,757 --> 01:28:24,964
You all right, Pete?

1367
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:26,249
Yeah.

1368
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:29,002
Because you look pale.

1369
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:32,304
You want something to drink?

1370
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:34,716
A bourbon or a Scotch,
or something like that?

1371
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:36,179
I'm not old enough to drink.

1372
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:38,139
That's the right answer.

1373
01:28:42,609 --> 01:28:45,352
- Do you look beautiful.
- Please don't embarrass me, Dad.

1374
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:46,940
Doesn't she, Pete?

1375
01:28:47,113 --> 01:28:49,480
Yeah, you look really good.

1376
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:51,866
Once again, that's the right answer.

1377
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:54,072
Is that a corsage?

1378
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:57,322
Thanks.

1379
01:28:57,499 --> 01:29:00,708
Well, hey, I'm your chauffeur,
so let's get this show on the road.

1380
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:04,041
No, no, no, we have to take
some pictures, babe. All right.

1381
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:06,456
- Oh, right here. Perfect.
- Mom.

1382
01:29:06,633 --> 01:29:08,090
Okay. Come on, you guys.

1383
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:10,927
Peter, closer.

1384
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,546
Smile.

1385
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:16,303
There you go.

1386
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:25,271
- Sir, you don't have to drive us.
- No, no, it's not a big deal.

1387
01:29:25,443 --> 01:29:27,651
I'm going out of town. It's right on my way.

1388
01:29:27,821 --> 01:29:29,733
- He's always going. Have fun.
- Last time.

1389
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:31,272
- Thank you.
- Promise.

1390
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:32,860
He's cute.

1391
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:37,536
- See you in a couple of days. All right.
- Bye, baby.

1392
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,288
Come on, Pedro.

1393
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:41,369
- Bye, Peter. Have fun.
- Yeah, I will.

1394
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:54,337
- What are you gonna do, Pete?
- What?

1395
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:56,547
When you graduate,
what do you think you'll do?

1396
01:29:56,725 --> 01:29:59,308
- Oh, I don't know.
- Don't grill him, Dad.

1397
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:02,053
Just saying, you know.

1398
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:03,971
All you guys who go to that school...

1399
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:06,562
...you pretty much have
your life planned out, right?

1400
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:09,272
Yeah, no, I'm just a sophomore.

1401
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:12,860
Peter has an internship with Tony Stark.
I think he doesn't have to worry.

1402
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:15,316
Really? Stark?

1403
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:17,200
So cool.

1404
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:19,407
What do you do?

1405
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:22,790
Yeah, actually,
I don't intern for him anymore.

1406
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:25,952
- Seriously?
- Yeah, it got...

1407
01:30:26,129 --> 01:30:27,165
...boring.

1408
01:30:27,339 --> 01:30:30,298
It was boring?
You got to hang out with Spider-Man.

1409
01:30:30,467 --> 01:30:32,379
Really? Spider-Man?

1410
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:35,423
What's he like?

1411
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:38,050
Yeah, he's nice.

1412
01:30:38,224 --> 01:30:40,056
Nice man.

1413
01:30:40,226 --> 01:30:42,058
Solid dude.

1414
01:30:44,981 --> 01:30:47,064
Look. So cute.

1415
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:54,655
I've seen you around, right? I mean...

1416
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:58,526
...somewhere. We've... Have we ever...
Because even the voice...

1417
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:01,036
He does Academic Decathlon with me.

1418
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,622
And he was at my party.

1419
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:06,159
It was a great party, really great, yeah.

1420
01:31:06,336 --> 01:31:10,546
- Beautiful house, a lot of windows.
- You were there for, like, two seconds.

1421
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:14,459
That was... I was there longer
than two seconds.

1422
01:31:14,636 --> 01:31:18,129
- You disappeared.
- No. No, I did not disappear.

1423
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:22,471
Yes, you did. You disappeared like
you always do, like you did in D.C. too.

1424
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:33,402
That's terrible what happened
down there in D.C. though.

1425
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:35,187
Were you scared?

1426
01:31:36,032 --> 01:31:38,524
I'll bet you were glad
when your old pal Spider-Man...

1427
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:40,785
...showed up in the elevator though, huh?

1428
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:45,288
Yeah, well, I actually didn't go up.

1429
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:47,199
I saw it all from the ground.

1430
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:49,543
Yeah.

1431
01:31:49,879 --> 01:31:52,212
Very lucky that he was there that day.

1432
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:57,923
Good old Spider-Man.

1433
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:03,428
Dad, the light.

1434
01:32:18,825 --> 01:32:21,033
Here we are. End of the line.

1435
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:22,613
Thanks, Dad.

1436
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:24,615
You head in there, gumdrop.

1437
01:32:24,789 --> 01:32:27,532
I'm gonna give Peter the "dad" talk.

1438
01:32:29,419 --> 01:32:31,376
Don't let him intimidate you.

1439
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:32,753
Love you.

1440
01:32:32,922 --> 01:32:35,380
- Love you, gumdrop.
- Have a safe flight.

1441
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:36,757
Hi.

1442
01:32:37,802 --> 01:32:40,089
You guys look so pretty.

1443
01:32:44,934 --> 01:32:45,970
Does she know?

1444
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:48,306
Know what?

1445
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,221
So she doesn't. Good.

1446
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:52,060
Close to the vest.

1447
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:53,394
I admire that.

1448
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:55,685
I've got a few secrets of my own.

1449
01:32:56,321 --> 01:33:00,156
Of all the reasons
I didn't want my daughter to date...

1450
01:33:02,327 --> 01:33:03,738
Peter...

1451
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:06,120
...nothing is more important than family.

1452
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:08,076
You saved my daughter's life.

1453
01:33:08,249 --> 01:33:10,081
I could never forget something like that.

1454
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:11,992
So I'm gonna give you one chance.

1455
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:13,286
Are you ready?

1456
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:16,998
You walk through those doors,
you forget any of this happened...

1457
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:20,793
...and don't you ever, ever...

1458
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:23,553
...interfere with my business again.

1459
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:25,635
Because if you do...

1460
01:33:25,809 --> 01:33:28,051
...I'll kill you...

1461
01:33:28,228 --> 01:33:29,810
...and everybody you love.

1462
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:32,896
I'll kill you dead.

1463
01:33:33,066 --> 01:33:35,854
That's what I'll do to protect my family.
Do you understand?

1464
01:33:37,779 --> 01:33:39,190
Hey.

1465
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:43,946
I just saved your life. Now what do you say?

1466
01:33:46,162 --> 01:33:47,494
Thank you.

1467
01:33:47,664 --> 01:33:49,405
You're welcome.

1468
01:33:49,582 --> 01:33:55,123
Now you go on in there and you show
my daughter a good time, okay?

1469
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,746
Just not too good.

1470
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:52,472
Hey.

1471
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:56,350
What did he say to you?

1472
01:35:00,612 --> 01:35:02,023
Gotta go.

1473
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:05,564
I'm sorry.

1474
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:07,862
You don't deserve this.

1475
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:30,639
He gave you a choice.

1476
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:32,891
- You chose wrong.
- What the hell?

1477
01:35:33,061 --> 01:35:34,723
What's with the crappy costume?

1478
01:35:37,148 --> 01:35:38,355
My web-shooters.

1479
01:35:47,283 --> 01:35:51,869
I wasn't sure about this thing at first,
but damn.

1480
01:35:57,043 --> 01:35:58,409
Gross.

1481
01:36:10,348 --> 01:36:12,840
- Why did he send you here?
- Guess you'll never know.

1482
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:19,180
Nice shot!

1483
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:25,645
Yes!

1484
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:27,654
Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz's dad.

1485
01:36:27,824 --> 01:36:29,690
- What?
- I gotta tell Mr. Stark.

1486
01:36:29,867 --> 01:36:32,701
Call Happy Hogan.
He's Mr. Stark's head of security.

1487
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:34,077
Get a computer and track my phone.

1488
01:36:34,497 --> 01:36:36,238
- Will you be okay?
- Hurry, we gotta catch him...

1489
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:38,703
...before he leaves town.

1490
01:36:38,876 --> 01:36:41,084
I'm sorry about dinner...

1491
01:36:41,504 --> 01:36:44,793
...but I know when branzino's fresh,
and that was not fresh, okay? So...

1492
01:36:46,259 --> 01:36:47,841
Flash, I need your car and phone.

1493
01:36:48,011 --> 01:36:50,754
Sir, technically,
this is my dad's car, sir. So I can't...

1494
01:36:59,355 --> 01:37:01,267
Hello, Ned? Hey, hey, can you hear me?

1495
01:37:01,441 --> 01:37:03,433
- Go for Ned.
- Ned, I need you...

1496
01:37:03,776 --> 01:37:05,938
- ...to track my phone.
- Yeah, but where is it?

1497
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:13,275
Genius move. Okay, he just passed
the GameStop on Jackson Avenue.

1498
01:37:13,453 --> 01:37:16,662
Hey, where are the headlights
on this thing? I'm in Flash's car.

1499
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:19,164
- I'll pull the specs.
- Okay, you're on speakerphone.

1500
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:22,293
- You stole Flash's car. Awesome.
- Yeah, it's awesome. It's...

1501
01:37:23,796 --> 01:37:25,833
Get out of the way, get out of the way! Move!

1502
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:27,623
- Are you okay?
- I've never driven before...

1503
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:31,464
...only with May in parking lots.
This is a huge step up.

1504
01:37:33,473 --> 01:37:34,884
Hey, have you gotten through to Happy yet?

1505
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:38,392
Yeah. I'm working on it.
I just gotta backdoor the phone system.

1506
01:37:41,814 --> 01:37:43,521
Guy in the chair.

1507
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:50,024
Takeoff in nine minutes.

1508
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:52,360
Hello? Hello? Who is this?

1509
01:37:52,533 --> 01:37:53,569
- Mr. Happy, it's Ned.
- Who?

1510
01:37:53,743 --> 01:37:56,030
I'm an associate of Peter Parker.
Got something very important to tell you...

1511
01:37:56,204 --> 01:37:57,740
You gotta be shitting me.

1512
01:37:58,456 --> 01:37:59,492
Damn.

1513
01:37:59,665 --> 01:38:02,032
Hey, Ned, how we coming on
with those headlights?

1514
01:38:03,628 --> 01:38:06,462
Round knob to the left
of the steering wheel, turn clockwise.

1515
01:38:06,631 --> 01:38:07,917
Left, okay.

1516
01:38:08,091 --> 01:38:09,878
Okay, perfect. So where's my phone now?

1517
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:13,051
He stopped in an old industrial park
in Brooklyn.

1518
01:38:13,221 --> 01:38:16,009
What? That makes no sense.
He said he was going out of town.

1519
01:38:16,182 --> 01:38:19,596
Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy.
Don't think he likes you, by the way.

1520
01:38:19,769 --> 01:38:21,431
It sounded like he was catching a flight.

1521
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:22,720
He said something about taking off
in nine minutes.

1522
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:24,889
- What?
- He was surrounded by boxes.

1523
01:38:25,066 --> 01:38:26,602
Boxes? It's moving day.

1524
01:38:26,776 --> 01:38:28,733
It's moving day. He's gonna rob that plane.

1525
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:30,769
I gotta stop him!

1526
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:35,737
All right, wheels up in eight minutes.

1527
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:38,493
We just got to load
Tony's old Hulkbuster Armor...

1528
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:42,077
...prototype for Cap's new shield,
and the Meging...

1529
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:43,786
The Meg... The...

1530
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:45,121
Thor's magic belt.

1531
01:38:46,462 --> 01:38:49,125
Okay, slow down.
You're getting close. It's on your right.

1532
01:38:49,298 --> 01:38:50,539
- What?
- Turn right.

1533
01:39:00,393 --> 01:39:02,680
- Peter. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1534
01:39:02,854 --> 01:39:05,267
Just keep trying to get through to Happy.

1535
01:39:05,731 --> 01:39:07,893
It's been an honor, Spider-Man.

1536
01:39:08,568 --> 01:39:10,776
What are you doing here? There's a dance.

1537
01:39:14,574 --> 01:39:15,610
I'm...

1538
01:39:15,783 --> 01:39:17,069
...Iooking...

1539
01:39:17,243 --> 01:39:19,405
...at porn.

1540
01:39:57,700 --> 01:39:58,736
Hey!

1541
01:40:00,286 --> 01:40:01,652
Surprised?

1542
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:03,695
Oh, hey, Pete.

1543
01:40:04,415 --> 01:40:05,701
I didn't hear you come in.

1544
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:07,958
It's over. I've got you.

1545
01:40:08,127 --> 01:40:10,119
You know, I gotta tell you, Pete...

1546
01:40:10,713 --> 01:40:13,626
...I really, really admire your grit.

1547
01:40:15,218 --> 01:40:16,379
I see why Liz likes you.

1548
01:40:18,596 --> 01:40:20,508
I do. When you first came to the house...

1549
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:23,799
...I wasn't sure.
I thought, "Really?" But I get it now.

1550
01:40:24,644 --> 01:40:26,385
How could you do this to her?

1551
01:40:26,562 --> 01:40:28,554
To her? I'm not doing anything to her, Pete.

1552
01:40:28,731 --> 01:40:31,064
I'm doing this for her.

1553
01:40:31,567 --> 01:40:32,603
Yeah.

1554
01:40:36,656 --> 01:40:38,113
Peter...

1555
01:40:38,991 --> 01:40:40,027
...you're young.

1556
01:40:40,201 --> 01:40:42,443
You don't understand how the world works.

1557
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:45,363
But I understand that selling weapons
to criminals is wrong.

1558
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:48,283
How do you think
your buddy Stark paid for that tower?

1559
01:40:48,459 --> 01:40:49,916
Or any of his little toys?

1560
01:40:50,086 --> 01:40:51,827
Those people, Pete, those people up there...

1561
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:54,291
...the rich and the powerful,
they do whatever they want.

1562
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:56,206
Guys like us...

1563
01:40:56,384 --> 01:40:58,250
...like you and me...

1564
01:40:58,427 --> 01:40:59,884
...they don't care about us.

1565
01:41:00,054 --> 01:41:02,512
We build their roads,
and we fight all their wars...

1566
01:41:02,682 --> 01:41:04,969
...and everything,
but they don't care about us.

1567
01:41:05,142 --> 01:41:09,307
We have to pick up after them.
We have to eat their table scraps.

1568
01:41:10,565 --> 01:41:12,557
That's how it is.

1569
01:41:12,942 --> 01:41:15,025
I know you know
what I'm talking about, Peter.

1570
01:41:15,194 --> 01:41:16,935
Why are you telling me this?

1571
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:19,571
Because I want you to understand.

1572
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:21,151
And...

1573
01:41:21,325 --> 01:41:24,318
...I needed a little time
to get her airborne.

1574
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:38,336
I'm sorry, Peter.

1575
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:45,468
What are you talking about?
That thing hasn't even touched me yet.

1576
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:48,175
True. Then again...

1577
01:41:48,352 --> 01:41:50,059
...wasn't really trying to.

1578
01:41:55,818 --> 01:41:57,434
Chief, they're powering up engines.

1579
01:41:57,612 --> 01:42:00,446
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.
- Come on, come on, come on.

1580
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:53,703
Okay, ready?

1581
01:43:02,635 --> 01:43:04,592
Hello?

1582
01:43:06,972 --> 01:43:08,429
Hello!

1583
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:10,181
Please, hey.

1584
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:12,888
Hey, please. I'm down here.

1585
01:43:13,062 --> 01:43:15,019
I'm down here. I'm stuck.

1586
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:17,977
I'm stuck. I can't move. I can't...

1587
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:38,835
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.

1588
01:43:44,593 --> 01:43:46,550
Come on, Peter.

1589
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:48,257
Come on, Spider-Man.

1590
01:43:48,431 --> 01:43:50,388
Come on, Spider-Man.

1591
01:43:50,558 --> 01:43:52,766
Come on, Spider-Man.

1592
01:43:54,645 --> 01:43:57,012
Come on, Spider-Man!

1593
01:44:48,199 --> 01:44:49,690
Launch for intercept.
Green light. Green light.

1594
01:44:50,075 --> 01:44:51,737
Oh, yeah.

1595
01:45:06,634 --> 01:45:08,921
Retroreflective panels engaged.

1596
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:23,853
Got a visual on the plane,
but I'm feeling a little resistance.

1597
01:45:24,026 --> 01:45:26,689
It's probably just drag on the new turbines.

1598
01:45:39,416 --> 01:45:42,580
Look out for the cloaking cameras.
Stay in the blind spots.

1599
01:45:52,096 --> 01:45:53,837
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1600
01:45:54,181 --> 01:45:56,594
Deploying high-altitude vacuum seal.

1601
01:45:56,767 --> 01:45:58,008
This better work, Mason.

1602
01:46:03,858 --> 01:46:06,896
Trust me, boss, even one of those boxes
and we are set for life.

1603
01:46:07,069 --> 01:46:08,355
Yeah.

1604
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:22,248
You have 30 seconds to get to the cockpit...

1605
01:46:22,418 --> 01:46:24,205
...and override their security.

1606
01:46:35,764 --> 01:46:37,300
Cloning transponder signal.

1607
01:46:37,474 --> 01:46:39,136
Launching decoy drone.

1608
01:46:43,272 --> 01:46:45,389
Entering new coordinates.

1609
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:52,566
Good, so it's on its way.

1610
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:55,574
- Yes, sir, right on course.
- Okay, thank you.

1611
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:57,821
All right.

1612
01:47:10,341 --> 01:47:11,957
Hot dog.

1613
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,432
Just a typical homecoming...

1614
01:48:03,602 --> 01:48:06,310
...on the outside of an invisible jet...

1615
01:48:07,022 --> 01:48:08,729
...fighting my girlfriend's dad.

1616
01:48:18,283 --> 01:48:19,364
Oh, God!

1617
01:48:26,959 --> 01:48:29,042
I can't believe that worked.

1618
01:49:05,539 --> 01:49:07,781
Chief, they're losing altitude.
Get out of there.

1619
01:49:07,958 --> 01:49:09,074
I'm not going home empty-handed.

1620
01:49:19,386 --> 01:49:21,173
Oh, my God.

1621
01:49:35,694 --> 01:49:38,528
- Get out of there. What are you doing?
- Please turn, please turn!

1622
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,207
Hey, Pedro.

1623
01:52:02,633 --> 01:52:03,669
Bingo.

1624
01:52:19,858 --> 01:52:21,645
Your wingsuit.

1625
01:52:21,818 --> 01:52:23,901
Your wingsuit's going to explode!

1626
01:52:31,286 --> 01:52:32,743
Time to go home, Pete.

1627
01:52:32,913 --> 01:52:34,370
I'm trying to save you!

1628
01:52:49,596 --> 01:52:50,962
No.

1629
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:53,176
No.

1630
01:54:32,741 --> 01:54:34,653
It looked so insane. That whole...

1631
01:54:34,826 --> 01:54:36,158
Like, it was just crazy.

1632
01:54:36,328 --> 01:54:38,695
He... He was just, like...

1633
01:54:38,872 --> 01:54:40,864
And you were like...

1634
01:54:41,041 --> 01:54:42,907
And then I just hit him with the...

1635
01:54:43,085 --> 01:54:44,951
It was so... Oh, my God.

1636
01:54:45,128 --> 01:54:47,120
I mean, you saved me.

1637
01:54:47,464 --> 01:54:49,080
It was awesome.

1638
01:54:55,055 --> 01:54:56,796
Hey, Liz.

1639
01:54:58,308 --> 01:54:59,469
I'm gonna miss you.

1640
01:54:59,976 --> 01:55:01,558
Bye.

1641
01:55:02,187 --> 01:55:03,644
Liz.

1642
01:55:10,487 --> 01:55:11,694
Liz, look, I'm so sorry.

1643
01:55:12,739 --> 01:55:15,732
You say that a lot.
What are you sorry for this time?

1644
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:18,196
The dance?

1645
01:55:19,538 --> 01:55:22,281
That was a pretty crappy thing to do.

1646
01:55:22,707 --> 01:55:23,788
Well, yeah, but I...

1647
01:55:23,959 --> 01:55:26,793
I mean, your dad... I can't imagine
what you're going through.

1648
01:55:26,962 --> 01:55:29,124
If there's anything I can do to help...

1649
01:55:29,297 --> 01:55:31,789
I guess we're moving to Oregon.

1650
01:55:31,967 --> 01:55:35,210
Mom says it's nice there, so that's cool.

1651
01:55:36,054 --> 01:55:40,219
Anyways, Dad doesn't want us here
during the trial. So...

1652
01:55:41,643 --> 01:55:44,306
Liz, I... I...

1653
01:55:44,479 --> 01:55:46,141
Bye, Peter.

1654
01:55:47,023 --> 01:55:50,516
Whatever's going on with you,
I hope you figure it out.

1655
01:56:03,039 --> 01:56:06,578
Congratulations,
decathlon national champions.

1656
01:56:06,751 --> 01:56:08,492
Yeah!

1657
01:56:08,962 --> 01:56:11,375
I'll have to put this back
in the trophy case soon...

1658
01:56:11,548 --> 01:56:14,040
...but just for motivation right now
at this practice.

1659
01:56:14,217 --> 01:56:15,879
I'm ahead of the game, but we will need...

1660
01:56:16,052 --> 01:56:17,588
...a new team captain next year.

1661
01:56:17,762 --> 01:56:20,425
So I am appointing Michelle.

1662
01:56:21,433 --> 01:56:23,095
Yeah!

1663
01:56:25,312 --> 01:56:26,519
Thank you.

1664
01:56:26,688 --> 01:56:28,145
My... My friends call me MJ.

1665
01:56:28,773 --> 01:56:30,810
I thought you didn't have any friends.

1666
01:56:30,984 --> 01:56:32,896
I didn't.

1667
01:56:37,782 --> 01:56:39,774
- I gotta go.
- Hey, where you going?

1668
01:56:42,496 --> 01:56:44,613
What are you hiding, Peter?

1669
01:56:46,917 --> 01:56:48,499
I'm just kidding. I don't care. Bye.

1670
01:56:48,668 --> 01:56:51,331
- All right, so we should run some drills.
- Yeah.

1671
01:56:59,763 --> 01:57:03,097
Hey, Happy. What... What are you doing here?

1672
01:57:04,059 --> 01:57:05,300
I really owe you one.

1673
01:57:07,395 --> 01:57:09,682
I don't know what I would do
without this job.

1674
01:57:09,856 --> 01:57:12,348
I mean, before I met Tony...

1675
01:57:41,471 --> 01:57:43,463
So how long you been here?

1676
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:45,802
Long enough to be awkward.
Boss wants to see you.

1677
01:57:46,768 --> 01:57:49,636
- Is he here too?
- In the toilet? No, he's upstate.

1678
01:57:50,188 --> 01:57:51,679
Upstate... Like, upstate-upstate?

1679
01:57:51,856 --> 01:57:53,438
Yeah, let's go.

1680
01:57:54,818 --> 01:57:55,934
Take a look.

1681
01:57:56,111 --> 01:57:58,148
It's pretty impressive, huh?

1682
01:57:59,239 --> 01:58:01,982
They just finished remodeling
the whole thing.

1683
01:58:28,184 --> 01:58:31,268
- You don't see that every day.
- Oh, there they are.

1684
01:58:31,938 --> 01:58:33,554
How was the ride up?

1685
01:58:33,982 --> 01:58:36,599
- Good.
- Give me a minute with the kid.

1686
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:39,192
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1687
01:58:39,613 --> 01:58:40,979
I gotta talk to the kid.

1688
01:58:41,573 --> 01:58:42,654
I'll be close behind.

1689
01:58:42,824 --> 01:58:46,568
How about a loose follow?
All right? Boundaries are good.

1690
01:58:51,583 --> 01:58:52,790
Sorry I took your suit.

1691
01:58:52,959 --> 01:58:55,451
You had it coming.
Actually, it turns out it was...

1692
01:58:55,629 --> 01:58:57,621
...the perfect tough-love moment
that you needed.

1693
01:58:57,797 --> 01:59:00,631
To urge you on, right?
Wouldn't you think? Don't you think?

1694
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,587
- I guess.
- Let's just say it was.

1695
01:59:04,471 --> 01:59:07,680
- Mr. Stark, I really...
- You screwed the pooch hard, bigtime.

1696
01:59:08,308 --> 01:59:09,970
But then you did the right thing.

1697
01:59:10,143 --> 01:59:13,307
Took the dog to the free clinic,
you raised the hybrid puppies...

1698
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:15,346
All right, not my best analogy.

1699
01:59:16,566 --> 01:59:18,478
I was wrong about you.

1700
01:59:19,027 --> 01:59:21,269
I think, with a little more mentoring...

1701
01:59:21,446 --> 01:59:23,904
...you could be a real asset to the team.

1702
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:27,532
- To the... To the team?
- Yeah. Anyway...

1703
01:59:27,702 --> 01:59:30,740
...there's about 50 reporters behind
that door. Real ones, not bloggers.

1704
01:59:31,247 --> 01:59:33,079
When you're ready...

1705
01:59:33,458 --> 01:59:35,165
...why don't you try that on?

1706
01:59:35,335 --> 01:59:39,249
And I'll introduce the world to the newest
official member of the Avengers:

1707
01:59:39,422 --> 01:59:41,084
Spider-Man.

1708
01:59:43,551 --> 01:59:45,133
I...

1709
01:59:46,805 --> 01:59:49,047
Yeah, give that a look.

1710
01:59:54,562 --> 01:59:56,724
After the press conference,
Happy will show you to your room...

1711
01:59:56,898 --> 01:59:57,979
...your new quarters.

1712
01:59:58,149 --> 02:00:00,391
Where's he between? He's next to Vision?

1713
02:00:00,568 --> 02:00:02,810
- Yeah, Vision's not big on doors.
- It's fun.

1714
02:00:02,987 --> 02:00:04,319
Or walls.

1715
02:00:04,489 --> 02:00:06,355
You'll fit right in.

1716
02:00:12,789 --> 02:00:14,781
Thank you, Mr. Stark.

1717
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:16,491
But I'm good.

1718
02:00:17,544 --> 02:00:20,036
You're good? Good... How are you good?

1719
02:00:20,213 --> 02:00:24,378
Well, I mean, I'd rather just stay
on the ground for a little while.

1720
02:00:24,551 --> 02:00:26,713
Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

1721
02:00:26,886 --> 02:00:28,843
Somebody's got to look out
for the little guy, right?

1722
02:00:29,305 --> 02:00:30,762
You're turning me down?

1723
02:00:30,932 --> 02:00:33,015
You better think about this. Look at that.

1724
02:00:33,184 --> 02:00:34,425
Look at me.

1725
02:00:35,186 --> 02:00:36,267
Last chance. Yes or no?

1726
02:00:36,438 --> 02:00:37,724
- No.
- Okay.

1727
02:00:37,897 --> 02:00:41,390
It's kind of a Springsteen-y,
working-class hero vibe that I dig.

1728
02:00:41,568 --> 02:00:43,560
Happy will take you home.

1729
02:00:43,737 --> 02:00:45,228
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1730
02:00:45,405 --> 02:00:47,567
Mind waiting in the car? I need a minute.

1731
02:00:49,117 --> 02:00:51,780
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.
- Yes, Mr. Parker, very well.

1732
02:00:51,953 --> 02:00:53,660
- See you around.
- Okay.

1733
02:01:01,880 --> 02:01:03,087
That was a test, right?

1734
02:01:03,882 --> 02:01:06,340
- There's nobody back there?
- Yes, you passed.

1735
02:01:07,218 --> 02:01:10,086
- All right, skedaddle there, young buck.
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.

1736
02:01:10,263 --> 02:01:11,970
Yeah, thank you.

1737
02:01:14,058 --> 02:01:15,924
Told you he's a good kid.

1738
02:01:22,192 --> 02:01:23,649
- Where's the kid?
- He left.

1739
02:01:23,818 --> 02:01:26,731
- Everybody's waiting.
- He actually made a mature choice.

1740
02:01:26,905 --> 02:01:29,898
- It just surprised the heck out of us.
- Did you screw this up?

1741
02:01:30,074 --> 02:01:32,157
- He told the kid to go wait in the car.
- Are you kidding?

1742
02:01:32,327 --> 02:01:34,489
I have a room full of people
in there waiting...

1743
02:01:34,662 --> 02:01:36,449
...for some big announcement.
What will I tell them?

1744
02:01:36,623 --> 02:01:39,115
Think of something. How about...

1745
02:01:39,667 --> 02:01:41,829
- Hap, you still got that ring?
- Do I... I...

1746
02:01:42,003 --> 02:01:43,164
- The engagement ring.
- Are you kidding?

1747
02:01:43,338 --> 02:01:46,547
I've been carrying this since 2008.

1748
02:01:49,219 --> 02:01:50,335
Okay.

1749
02:01:50,512 --> 02:01:52,094
I think I can think
of something better than that.

1750
02:01:52,263 --> 02:01:54,630
Well, it would buy us a little time.

1751
02:01:55,934 --> 02:01:58,051
Like we need time.

1752
02:01:58,228 --> 02:01:59,890
I can't believe you have that in your pocket.

1753
02:02:00,063 --> 02:02:02,555
- Want me to get the door for you, hon?
- I got it.

1754
02:02:18,748 --> 02:02:21,206
Aunt May, did you do dinner already?

1755
02:02:31,469 --> 02:02:33,131
May?

1756
02:02:54,909 --> 02:02:55,945
What the...

1757
02:05:10,044 --> 02:05:12,001
Look who it is.

1758
02:05:13,923 --> 02:05:17,087
What are the odds you and I'd end up
at the same summer camp?

1759
02:05:17,260 --> 02:05:18,546
Relax.

1760
02:05:19,178 --> 02:05:21,170
This? It's not on you.

1761
02:05:21,347 --> 02:05:24,431
It's on our little spider friend.

1762
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:28,184
I've got some boys on the outside
who would love to meet him.

1763
02:05:28,354 --> 02:05:31,813
You know, take a picture,
slice his throat, put his head in a dryer.

1764
02:05:32,358 --> 02:05:34,600
And I heard a rumor.

1765
02:05:37,864 --> 02:05:39,446
You know who he is.

1766
02:05:43,202 --> 02:05:45,535
If I knew who he was...

1767
02:05:45,705 --> 02:05:47,287
...he'd already be dead.

1768
02:05:51,836 --> 02:05:54,704
Toomes, your family's here!

1769
02:12:33,821 --> 02:12:36,655
Hi, I'm Captain America,
here to talk to you...

1770
02:12:36,824 --> 02:12:40,784
...about one of the most valuable traits
a soldier or student can have.

1771
02:12:40,953 --> 02:12:42,615
Patience.

1772
02:12:42,788 --> 02:12:44,905
Sometimes patience is the key to victory.

1773
02:12:45,082 --> 02:12:47,119
Sometimes it leads to very little...

1774
02:12:47,293 --> 02:12:49,626
...and it seems like it's not worth it.

1775
02:12:49,795 --> 02:12:51,286
And you wonder...

1776
02:12:51,464 --> 02:12:55,299
...why you waited so long
for something so disappointing.

1777
02:12:59,013 --> 02:13:01,005
How many more of these?
