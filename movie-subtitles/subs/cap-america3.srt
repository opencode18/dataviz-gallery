That is good to know,

171
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,570
I will plan my toga party accordingly.

Where you going?

173
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:42,656
Your father's flying us

174
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,180
to the Bahamas for a little getaway.

175
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,743
We might have to make a quick stop.

176
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,995
At the Pentagon. Right?

177
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,165
Don't worry, you're gonna love
the holiday menu at the commissary.

you'll be a great man someday.

And frankly, you're going to miss us.

No, but it's run by people

479
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:40,673
with agendas, and agendas change.

480
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,675
That's good. That's why I'm here.

481
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,404
When I realised what my weapons
were capable of in the wrong hands...

482
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:47,028
I shut it down
and stopped manufacturing.

483
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:49,516

484
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:52,519
If we sign this, we surrender
our right to choose.

485

What if this panel sends us somewhere
we don't think we should go?

We may not be perfect,

but the safest hands are still our own.

If we don't do this now,

491

it's gonna be done to us later.

492
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:08,409
That's the fact. That won't be pretty.

00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:09,803

And now, because your friend
murdered my father...

823
00:55:46,594 --> 00:55:49,264
I also wear the mantle of king.

Felt timely.

864

FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill
with these in 1941.

Provided support to the Allies

Some would say it brought
our country closer to war.

you wouldn't be here.

I'm trying to... What do you call it?

869
00:58:23,293 --> 00:58:25,253
That's an olive branch.

870
00:58:26,087 --> 00:58:27,589
Is that what you call it?

No. Definitely not.

875
00:58:39,392 --> 00:58:41,186
We're taking a break.

876
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:42,562
It's nobody's fault.

877
00:58:44,147 --> 00:58:45,607
I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.

878
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:49,360
A few years ago, I almost lost her,
so I trashed all my suits.

879
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:52,363
Then, we had to mop up HYDRA...

880
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,866
and then Ultron. My fault.

881
00:58:55,033 --> 00:58:58,244
And then, and then, and then,
I never stopped.

882
00:58:58,411 --> 00:59:00,788
Because the truth is I don't wanna stop.

883
00:59:02,165 --> 00:59:04,209
I don't wanna lose her.

884
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:07,003
I thought maybe the Accords
could split the difference.

885
00:59:10,632 --> 00:59:12,800
In her defense, I'm a handful.

886
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:16,471
Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass,

887
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:18,348

889

I only knew him
when he was young and single.

890
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:24,729
Oh, really? You two knew each other?

891
00:59:24,812 --> 00:59:26,189
He never mentioned that.

892
00:59:26,356 --> 00:59:28,983
Maybe only a thousand times.

893
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:30,985
God, I hated you.

894
00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:34,614
I don't mean to make things difficult.

895
00:59:34,781 --> 00:59:37,075
I know, because you're
a very polite person.

896
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,994
If I see a situation pointed south...

897
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:42,330
I can't ignore it.

898
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:43,790
Sometimes I wish I could.

899
00:59:43,957 --> 00:59:44,999
No, you don't.

00:59:48,127 --> 00:59:49,629
No, I don't.

Sometimes...

902
00:59:51,506 --> 00:59:54,550
Sometimes I wanna
punch you in your perfect teeth.

903
00:59:55,134 --> 00:59:56,594
But I don't wanna see you gone.

904
00:59:57,345 --> 00:59:58,846
We need you, Cap.

905
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:03,017
So far, nothing's happened
that can't be undone, if you sign.

instead of a Wakandan prison.

909

I'm not saying it's impossible...

910
01:00:23,204 --> 01:00:25,206
but there would have to be safeguards.

911
01:00:25,373 --> 01:00:26,416
Sure.

912
01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:28,293
Once we put out the PR fire,

913
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:30,378
those documents can be amended.

914
01:00:30,545 --> 01:00:32,439
I'd file a motion to have
you and Wanda reinstated...

915
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:34,299
Wanda? What about Wanda?

916
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:36,277
She's fine. She's confined
to the compound, currently.

917
01:00:36,301 --> 01:00:37,510
Vision's keeping her company.

918
01:00:37,677 --> 01:00:38,677
Oh, God, Tony.

919
01:00:38,845 --> 01:00:41,180
Every time I think you see
things the right way...

920

It's 100 acres with a lap pool.

921
01:00:42,432 --> 01:00:43,474
It's got a screening room.

922
01:00:43,558 --> 01:00:44,785
There's worse ways to protect people.

923
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:45,852
Protection?

924
01:00:46,561 --> 01:00:47,645
Is that how you see this?

925
01:00:47,729 --> 01:00:49,772
This is protection? It's internment, Tony.

926
01:00:49,939 --> 01:00:51,333
- She's not a US citizen.
- Oh, come on, Tony.

927
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:52,918
And they don't grant visas
to weapons of mass destruction.

928
01:00:52,942 --> 01:00:53,943
She's a kid!

929
01:00:54,027 --> 01:00:55,403
Give me a break!

01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:29,980
You've been getting my emails, right?

1148
01:17:30,188 --> 01:17:31,773
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?

1149
01:17:31,982 --> 01:17:32,983
Regarding the...

1150
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:34,210
You didn't even tell me about the grant.

1151
01:17:34,234 --> 01:17:35,878
- About the grant.
- The September Foundation.

1152
01:17:35,902 --> 01:17:36,902
- Right.
- Yeah.

1153
01:17:36,945 --> 01:17:37,985
Remember when you applied?

1154
01:17:38,071 --> 01:17:39,114
Yeah.

1155
01:17:39,281 --> 01:17:41,783
I approved, so now we're in business.

1156
01:17:42,409 --> 01:17:44,489
But you didn't tell me anything.
What's up with that?

1157
01:17:44,619 --> 01:17:45,763
You keeping secrets from me now?

1158
01:17:45,787 --> 01:17:49,583
I just know how much you love surprises
so I thought I would let you know...

1159
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:51,752
Anyway, what did I apply for?

1160
01:17:51,918 --> 01:17:53,062
That's what I'm here to hash out.

1161
01:17:53,086 --> 01:17:54,463
Okay. Hash it out, okay.

1162
01:17:54,546 --> 01:17:57,174
It's so hard for me to believe
that she's someone's aunt.

1163
01:17:57,341 --> 01:17:59,593
Yeah, well, we come in
all shapes and sizes, you know?

1164
01:18:00,052 --> 01:18:02,220
This walnut date loaf is exceptional.

1165
01:18:02,512 --> 01:18:03,906
- Let me just stop you there.
- Yeah.

1166
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:07,726
Is this grant got money
involved or whatever? No?

1167
01:18:07,893 --> 01:18:09,203
TONY: Yeah, it's pretty well funded.

1168
01:18:09,227 --> 01:18:10,395
Yeah? Wow.

1169
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:12,105
Look who you're talking to.

1170
01:18:12,272 --> 01:18:14,316
- Can I have five minutes with him?
- Sure.

1171
01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:23,533
As walnut date loaves go,
that wasn't bad.

1172
01:18:24,826 --> 01:18:27,621
Whoa, what have we here?
Retro tech, huh?

1173
01:18:27,829 --> 01:18:29,581
Thrift store? Salvation Army?

1174
01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:31,851
- Uh, the garbage, actually.
- You're a dumpster diver?

1175
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:32,959
Yeah, I was...

1176
01:18:33,043 --> 01:18:34,503
Anyway, look, um,

1177
01:18:34,586 --> 01:18:36,306
I definitely did not apply
for your grant...

1178
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:37,923
- Ah-ah! Me first.
- Okay.

1179
01:18:38,006 --> 01:18:40,509
Quick question of the rhetorical variety.

1180
01:18:41,843 --> 01:18:43,804
That's you, right?

1181
01:18:44,179 --> 01:18:45,180
Um, no.

1182
01:18:45,347 --> 01:18:46,827
- (STAMMERS) What do you mean?
- Yeah.

1183
01:18:47,808 --> 01:18:49,434
Look at you go.

1184
01:18:49,601 --> 01:18:52,729
Wow! Nice catch.
3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour.

1185
01:18:52,896 --> 01:18:55,649
That's not easy. You got mad skills.

1186
01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:57,734
That's all on YouTube, though, right?

1187
01:18:57,818 --> 01:18:59,319
That's where you found that?

1188
01:18:59,486 --> 01:19:00,588
Because you know that's all fake.

1189
01:19:00,612 --> 01:19:01,812
It's all done on the computer.

1190
01:19:01,863 --> 01:19:02,906
Mmm-hmm.

1191
01:19:02,989 --> 01:19:05,075
It's like that video. What is it?

1192
01:19:05,242 --> 01:19:07,122
Yeah. Oh, you mean like
those UFOs over Phoenix?

1193
01:19:07,202 --> 01:19:08,202
Exactly.

1194
01:19:08,537 --> 01:19:09,830
Oh, what have we here?

1195
01:19:11,206 --> 01:19:12,916
- Uh...
- (CLATTERS)

1196
01:19:14,126 --> 01:19:15,335
(EXHALES)

1197
01:19:18,964 --> 01:19:20,799
You're the Spider-ling.

1198
01:19:20,966 --> 01:19:22,843
Crime-fighting spider.
You're Spider-Boy?

1199
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,264
Spider-Man.

1200
01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:29,474
Not in that onesie, you're not.

1201
01:19:30,016 --> 01:19:31,935
It's not a onesie.

1202
01:19:33,353 --> 01:19:34,705
I don't believe this.
I was actually having

1203
01:19:34,729 --> 01:19:36,523
a really good day today, Mr Stark.

1204
01:19:36,690 --> 01:19:39,860
Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good
DVD player was just sitting there...

1205
01:19:40,485 --> 01:19:43,113
and Algebra test, nailed it.

1206
01:19:43,905 --> 01:19:45,365
Who else knows? Anybody?

1207
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:48,076
Nobody.

1208
01:19:48,452 --> 01:19:50,454
Not even your unusually attractive aunt?

1209
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:51,913
No. No.

1210
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,666
No! If she knew, she would freak out.

1211
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,543
And when she freaks out, I freak out.

1212
01:19:56,835 --> 01:19:58,835
You know what I think
is really cool? This webbing.

1213
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:02,507
That tensile strength is off the charts.

1214
01:20:02,591 --> 01:20:03,967
Who manufactured that?

1215
01:20:04,259 --> 01:20:05,469
I did.

1216
01:20:06,553 --> 01:20:08,138
Climbing walls, how you doing that?

1217
01:20:08,305 --> 01:20:09,556
Adhesive gloves?

1218
01:20:09,723 --> 01:20:11,016
It's a long story. I was...

1219
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:13,852
Lordy! Can you even see in these?

1220
01:20:14,019 --> 01:20:15,020
Yes, I can.

1221
01:20:15,187 --> 01:20:16,354
I'm blind!

1222
01:20:17,314 --> 01:20:18,899
I can see in those.

1223
01:20:19,065 --> 01:20:19,900
Okay?

1224
01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:22,402
It's just that when whatever
happened, happened...

1225
01:20:22,486 --> 01:20:24,779
it's like my senses
have been dialled to 11.

1226
01:20:25,322 --> 01:20:29,618
There's way too much input,
so they just kinda help me focus.

1227
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:32,204
You're in dire need of an upgrade.

1228
01:20:32,287 --> 01:20:34,664
Systemic, top to bottom,
hundred-point restoration.

1229
01:20:34,748 --> 01:20:35,874
That's why I'm here.

1230
01:20:38,793 --> 01:20:39,920
Why you doing this?

1231
01:20:41,338 --> 01:20:42,506
I gotta know, what's your MO?

1232
01:20:42,589 --> 01:20:44,509
What gets you outta that
twin bed in the morning?

1233
01:20:45,133 --> 01:20:46,343
Because...

1234
01:20:47,677 --> 01:20:48,762
(STAMMERS)

1235
01:20:50,388 --> 01:20:52,349
Because I've been me my whole life,

1236
01:20:52,432 --> 01:20:54,100
and I've had these powers
for six months.

1237
01:20:54,559 --> 01:20:55,727
Mmm-hmm.

1238
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:58,188
I read books, I build computers.

1239
01:20:59,397 --> 01:21:02,067
Yeah, I would love to play football,

1240
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:03,750
but I couldn't then, so I shouldn't now.

1241
01:21:03,944 --> 01:21:05,445
Sure, because you're different.

1242
01:21:05,612 --> 01:21:08,532
Exactly. But I can't tell
anybody that, so I'm not.

1243
01:21:12,244 --> 01:21:16,540
When you can do the things
that I can, but you don't...

1244
01:21:18,959 --> 01:21:21,086
and then the bad things happen...

1245
01:21:21,836 --> 01:21:23,463
they happen because of you.

1246
01:21:28,134 --> 01:21:30,720
So you wanna look out for the little guy,
you wanna do your part?

1247
01:21:30,887 --> 01:21:33,098
Make the world
a better place, all that, right?

1248
01:21:33,348 --> 01:21:35,892
Yeah, just looking out for the little guy.

1249
01:21:36,893 --> 01:21:38,478
That's what it is.

1250
01:21:45,735 --> 01:21:47,904
I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.

1251
01:21:51,741 --> 01:21:52,867
(TONY EXHALES)

1252
01:21:56,830 --> 01:21:58,039
You got a passport?

1253
01:21:58,123 --> 01:21:59,642
No, I don't even have a driver's license.

1254
01:21:59,666 --> 01:22:01,126
- You ever been to Germany?
- No.

1255
01:22:01,209 --> 01:22:02,210
Oh, you'll love it.

1256
01:22:02,419 --> 01:22:04,337
- I can't go to Germany.
- Why?

1257
01:22:06,798 --> 01:22:08,008
I got homework.

1258
01:22:08,675 --> 01:22:10,594
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

1259
01:22:10,844 --> 01:22:12,905
No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop out of school.

1260
01:22:12,929 --> 01:22:14,049
Might be a little dangerous.

1261
01:22:14,097 --> 01:22:16,257
Better tell Aunt Hottie
I'm taking you on a field trip.

1262
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:20,645
Don't tell Aunt May.

1263
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:22,564
All right, Spider-Man.

1264
01:22:26,192 --> 01:22:27,402
Get me out of this.

1265
01:22:27,569 --> 01:22:28,612
Sorry. I'll get the...

1270
01:22:51,009 --> 01:22:52,510
Guess I shoulda knocked.

1271
01:22:52,844 --> 01:22:56,097
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

1272
01:22:56,264 --> 01:22:58,558
Disappointing my kids.

1273
01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:03,855
I'm supposed to go waterskiing.

1274

1276
01:23:09,402 --> 01:23:10,695
You should not be here.

1277
01:23:13,031 --> 01:23:14,282
Really?

1278
01:23:14,783 --> 01:23:17,869
I retire for, what, like five minutes,
and it all goes to shit.

1279
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:20,330
Please consider
the consequences of your actions.

1280
01:23:20,497 --> 01:23:21,497
Okay, they're considered.

(GROANS)

1282
01:23:22,874 --> 01:23:24,376
Okay, we gotta go.

1283
01:23:28,755 --> 01:23:30,048
It's this way.

1284
01:23:30,507 --> 01:23:32,425
I've caused enough problems.

Look, you wanna mope,
you can go to high school.

1288
01:23:40,517 --> 01:23:42,560
You wanna make amends,
you get off your ass.

1289
01:23:43,561 --> 01:23:44,561
Shit.

01:23:51,152 --> 01:23:52,904
I knew I should've stretched.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

VISION: Clint, you can't overpower me.

1294
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:11,005
I know I can't.

1295
01:24:11,589 --> 01:24:13,174
But she can.

1296
01:24:14,718 --> 01:24:17,804
Vision, that's enough. Let him go.

1297
01:24:18,722 --> 01:24:19,723
I'm leaving.

1298

I can't let you.

1299
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,355
I'm sorry.

1300
01:24:30,859 --> 01:24:32,694
If you do this...

1301
01:24:33,153 --> 01:24:36,156
they will never stop being afraid of you.

1302
01:24:37,615 --> 01:24:40,952
I can't control their fear, only my own.

1303
01:24:53,173 --> 01:24:54,424

1304
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:58,803
Come on. We got one more stop.
